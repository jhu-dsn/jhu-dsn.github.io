            <p>Critical applications are becoming more connected to the
            Internet for cost-effectiveness and scalability reasons, but this
            leaves them vulnerable to attack. Most systems today are not
            designed to withstand sophisticated attacks; an attacker who is
            able to compromise a single machine typically gains the power to
            take down the entire system. Our lab is working to develop systems
            that continue to work correctly even when some parts of the system
            become compromised.</p>

            <p>Our research in this area focuses on building intrusion-tolerant systems for
            critical infrastruture monitoring and control. In critical infrastruture, intrusion-tolerant systems 
            not only need intrusion-tolerant communication and intrusion-tolerant consistent state to perform correct
            operations, but also strict real-time reponsiveness even in presence of faults, attacks and intrusions.
            Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) operations in power grid control centers typically 
            require latency of 100-200ms and the requirements become much more stringent as we move from 
            control centers to substations that carry out critical protection functions (4.167ms), due to the physical 
            properties of the system.</p>

            <p>Our current research in this area focuses on developing Byzantine resilient techniques 
            for the grid substations. Substaions play a key role in grid resilience as 
            they protect grid assets during risky events and ensure reliable power supply. 
            A grid asset like a high voltage transformer (345kV and up) 
            serves vast spans of the grid, costs millions of dollars, and takes over a year to procure, 
            damaging it threatens grid stability. However, existing state-of-the-art protective schemes are
            susceptible to intrusions i,e., a compromied protection device can damage assets or cause significant disruptions.
            The challenge is to maintain correct protective opreations in susbations, meeting the latency requirements (4.167ms) and 
            remain available even when up to a certain fraction of the protection devices are compromised. </p>

            <p>We developed the first architecture and protocols for the substation that ensure correct protection operations
            in the face of successful intrusions and network attacks while meeting the required latency constraint (4.167ms).
            Our current work uses proactive recovery and diversity to allow Byzantine resileint systems 
            to survive an unbounded number of compromises over the system lifetime, as long as the number of simultaneous 
            compromises does not exceed a certain threshold. A key component of this work is the practical use of diversity 
            to support the standard assumption that all machines in a system are not compromised simultaneously. If all machines 
            run exactly the same programs in exactly the same environment, the same exploit will be effective against all of them. 
            Because of this, it is necessary to add diversity in order to build resilient systems. 
            Our current work in this area includes combining diversity and proactive recovery for Spire.</p>

            <p>Our Spire, an open-source intrusion-tolerant SCADA system is built to address the use cases of power grid at 
            both control center and substation levels. More information can be found at <a href="https://jhu-dsn.github.io/spire">Spire</a> webpage</p>

            <p>Successful intrusions (compromises) of the control servers can cause the system to behave 
            in incorrect ways (exhibiting arbitrary/Byzantine behavior - caused due to cyber attacks), 
            as opposed to simply becoming unavailable (non-malicious - like those due to natural disasters).
            Because of the differences between these two failure modes, the dependability reserach has traditionally 
            considered them separately, developing crash-fault-tolerant system architectures and protocols to 
            address non-malicious faults, and Byzantine-fault-tolerant protocols to address arbitrary or malicious faults.
            However, recents trends have shown a novel threat model - an increasing cyberattacks that are targeted in the aftermath of a natural disaster 
            posing an important emerging threat for critical infrastructure. This novel <b>compound threat model</b> and the impact of such 
            threats on critical infrastructure are not well understood.</p> 
            
            <p>Our research defines the novel threat model and develops a framework to assess the impact of 
            novel compound threats on critical infrastructure with the aim to develop severe 
            impact resilient systems for critical infrastruture. The new analysis framework 
            integrates a data-based model of natural disaster effects with a concrete model of an attackerâ€™s
            power to determine the probability of a given system instance surviving a specific compound threat.
            Using this data-centric framework, we perform case-study analysis of an attacker attempting to disrupt a power-grid SCADA systems.
            Our results show that while fault and intrusion-tolerant architectures deployed today or 
            proposed in the literature offer some protection against compound threats, no existing architecture 
            is designed to handle such threats, and none can guarantee uninterrupted operation under the full compound threat models considered.
            </p>

            <p>Further, our research aims to design, develop and deploy systems with novel architectures to 
            withstand the compound threat using a combination of intrusion-tolerant techniques, mobile solutions and flexibity.

            href="https://www.womeninhpc.org/hpc/icdcs-best-paper-internet-transport-service/">
            blog post</a> describes our recent work on a timely, reliable, and
            cost-effective Internet transport service, which received the best paper
            award at IEEE ICDCS 2017. (07/13/2017)</p>

            <p> New applications with demands such as low latency and high
            reliability are challenging to support on the native Internet due
            to the Internet's extreme scalability requirements. Our lab works
            to enable these types of demanding applications using overlay
            networks. </p>

            <p> Our lab has developed the open-source <a
            href="https://spines-org.github.io">Spines Overlay Messaging system</a>,
            which provides a framework for deploying software overlay routers,
            as well as algorithms to provide high-quality VoIP service using
            overlays. The Spines framework is used commercially on 
            a global scale.</p>

            <p> We are currently interested in supporting even more demanding
            applications, such as remote manipulation, which requires closing a
            130ms round-trip loop to provide the operator with realistic
            feedback.</p>

            <p>Today's cloud applications have a variety of communication and
            coordination needs, both within a single data center and among
            geographically dispersed data centers. Our research in this area
            focuses on high-performance messaging systems that guarantee strong
            semantics, as well as high-performance replication.</p>
            
            <p>In our work on messaging systems, our lab has developed the <a
            href="http://www.spread.org">Spread toolkit</a>, an open-source,
            widely-used group communication system, and <a
            href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/research/group/secure_spread">Secure
            Spread</a>, a library that adds security to Spread. More recently,
            we designed a new message ordering protocol, the Accelerated Ring
            protocol, and implemented it in the Spread toolkit (<a
            href="http://www.spread.org/SpreadReleases.html">version 4.4.0 and
            up</a>), improving both its throughput and latency for reliable,
            agreed order, and safe message delivery.</p>

            <p>In our work on replication, we have developed <a
            href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/Paxos-SB.html">Paxos for System
            Builders</a>, a complete specification and implementation of the
            Paxos state-machine replication algorithm, and begun work comparing
            replication protocols based on group communication to other
            approaches (including Paxos). We are currently continuing this work
            to develop a complete understanding of the tradeoffs of different
            replication techniques.</p>

            <p>In addition, we are currently interested in strong consistency
            guarantees for Big Data systems.</p>
