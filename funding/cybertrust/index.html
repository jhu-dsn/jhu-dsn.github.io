<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>

This project focuses on the theoretical foundation and the protocols that
facilitate a survivable information infrastructure that meets the critical
requirements of a national emergency response system. Specifically, the
project will address the following challenges:
<ul>
<li>Expand the existing theoretical framework to analyze the behavior of
malicious and colluding participants.
<li>Design and construct a scalable survivable messaging system that operates
correctly under a strong adversarial model that includes insider threat and
denial of service attacks. 
<li>Design and construct information access protocols that protect against
compromised database servers providing incorrect data or servers that deny
access to legitimate users. 
<li>Prevent malicious users from learning unauthorized information.
</ul>
The domain of application for this work is the Clinicians' Biodefense
Network (CBN), a nationwide Internet-based information exchange system
designed to provide clinicians with critical information in the aftermath of
a bioterrorist attack. The CBN is designed to mitigate benign Internet
faults and to resist a physical attack on one location. However, it is not
able to correctly operate under a stronger threat model that includes
insider attacks. Solutions for this stronger threat model are not currently
available and present a major research challenge.  This project will
construct a prototype survivable system based on the CBN, and from it draw
general principles. It will develop a solid theoretical foundation and novel
system tools to facilitate building national emergency networks that are
resilient against cyber-attacks in crisis situations, when those networks
are most urgently needed.

            Scaling Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Replication to Wide Area Networks</a>

	This paper presents the first hierarchical Byzantine fault-tolerant replication architecture suitable to systems that span multiple wide area sites. The architecture confines the effects of any malicious replica to its local site, reduces message complexity of wide area communication, and allows read-only queries to be performed locally within a site for the price of additional standard hardware. We present proofs that our algorithm provides safety and liveness properties. A prototype implementation is evaluated over several network topologies and is compared with a flat Byzantine fault-tolerant approach. The experimental results show considerable improvement over flat Byzantine replication algorithms, bringing the performance of Byzantine replication closer to existing benign fault-tolerant replication techniques over wide area networks.

	       In this paper we describe two algorithms to improve the performance of
	       VoIP applications. These mechanisms are used for localized packet
	       loss recovery and rapid rerouting in the event of network
	       failures. The algorithms are deployed on the routers of an
	       application-level overlay network and require no changes to the
	       underlying infrastructure. Initial experimental results indicate that
	       these two approaches can be composed to yield voice quality on par
	       with the PSTN.

             Reliable Communication in Overlay Networks</a><br><small>
	     In the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on
	     Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN03), San Francisco, June 2003.<br>
	     Yair Amir and Claudiu Danilov<br>
	     Reliable point-to-point communication is usually achieved in overlay 
	     networks by applying TCP/IP on the end nodes of a connection. This paper 
	     presents an hop-by-hop reliability approach that considerably reduces the 
	     latency and jitter of reliable connections. Our approach is feasible and 
	     beneficial in overlay networks that do not have the scalability and 
	     interoperability requirements of the global Internet.<br>
	     The effects of the hop-by-hop reliability approach are quantified in 
	     simulation as well as in practice using a newly developed overlay network 
	     software that is fair with the external traffic on the Internet. The 
	     experimental results show that the overhead associated with overlay network 
	     processing at the application level does not play an important factor 
	     compared with the considerable gain of the approach.
