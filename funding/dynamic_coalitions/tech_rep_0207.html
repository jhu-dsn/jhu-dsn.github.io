<h2>Yearly Technical Report, July 2002</h2>

<h3><font color="blue">Objective:</font></h3>
<P>
A practical group communication system should provide secure multicast
services for peer groups over local and wide area networks. To support
the environment described in the Dynamic Coalition program, such a
system should scale to tens of coalition parties, with hundreds of
servers, supporting thousands of users. This service is crucial for
building distributed applications that work in dynamic environments
and communicate over unsecured networks (e.g.  the Internet). It is
also important for enabling other infrastructures for these
environments, such as replicated certification, highly available
policy management, and high performance access control.
<p>
A common claim today is that a wide-area, secure group communication
system with strict reliability semantics and strict security
requirements, cannot perform well enough to be practical. Based on our
past and current work, we claim that with careful protocol design, a
system that is limited to the size of the above peer groups can
perform well without relaxing any of the security or reliability
guarantees. The objective of this project is to build it.

<h3><font color="blue">Approach:</font></h3>
<P>
Our technical approach builds our work with the Spread group
communication system (http://www.spread.org) and the CLIQUES key
agreement protocols suite (http://sconce.ics.uci.edu/cliques/). Our
approach includes the following innovative aspects:
<ul>
<li> Constructing group communication protocols that support wide and
local area networks with tens of sites, hundreds of servers, and
thousands of users.
<li> Current key agreement protocols are not designed to tolerate
failures and changes in the membership during their execution. Our
protocols, in contrast, will be completely resilient to any sequence
of such events. We believe this will be the first robust
implementation of distributed key agreement protocols that provide
perfect forward secrecy, group membership authentication,
non-repudiation, and resilience to known-key attacks.
<li> The performance of a group key generation protocol is very
dependent on the network structure, the relative power of machines,
and the algorithm used. We do not think that there can be one key
agreement protocol that outperforms all other protocols in all of the
possible environments.  Instead, we will develop several different
algorithms, each optimized (performance-wise) for a different setting.
<li> We design and build a modular architecture that allows different
security protocols to be plugged in. The architecture will switch
protocols during execution in agreement with other members, so that
the most suitable protocol for the current situation is invoked. The
selection will be based on the current state of the network, available
system resources, the number of members in the group, a user defined
policy, etc.
<li> The current state of the art in secure group communication
implements security as a layer, separate from the reliability,
ordering, and membership services. Although this structure has much
merit, there is a high performance cost attached. We will build two
versions of our system that share most of the code and
infrastructure. The Layered Architecture version will have the
security services provided on top of the reliability, ordering and
membership services.  The Integrated Architecture version will tailor
the security protocols into the core reliability, ordering and
membership services, drastically cutting the latency and bandwidth
cost associated with group membership changes.
<li> In a Dynamic Coalition environment, it is likely that each
coalition party will retain its autonomy, which includes full control
over its part of the infrastructure. This is in contrast to current
group communication architectures that assume one administrative
domain. Our system will allow multiple autonomous control domains,
while still preserving the tightly coupled group communication
semantics.
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Recent accomplishments:</font></h3>
<h4>Layered architecture</h4>
<p>
During the last year, we achieved one of the main milestones for the project
by releasing Secure Spread 2.0. This system includes implementation of 
five different key agreement protocols and allows evaluation of all of
them under the same system. The Secure Spread system
now supports these key agreement protocols:
<ul>
<li> BD (Burmester Desmedt) - a protocol that requires three rounds
and upto n multicasts in each round, and is fairly easy to make it
robust.
<li> CKD (Centralized Key Distribution) - a protocol that selects a
leader based on the membership of a group and that leader computes a
key and disseminates it to the others.
<li> GDH (Group Diffie Hellman) - our basic CLIQUES protocol.
<li> STR - A sparse tree group Diffie Hellman.
<li> TGDH (Tree-based Group Diffie Hellman).
</ul>
<p>
We have experimented with the five different protocols over a local
area network. Using the Secure Spread framework
supporting five key agreement protocols, we conducted extensive tests over
high-latency wide area networks. Results discussing the performance and
the trade-offs of these protocols on both local and wide area networks
are presented in a technical report below.

<h4>Integrated Architecture</h4>
<p>
We completed an initial implementation of our access control framework
which is part of our integrated architecture.  This framework
specifies a modular architecture allowing multiple access control and
authentication protocols to be used and the location of checks in the
group communication system to enforce the policies.  The access
control and authentication framework adds two new features to the
Spread group communication system. First, it provides a modular API
that allows anyone to write a custom authentication and access control
policy code module which will be loaded into the Spread daemon. This
module (or modules) will control how clients are authenticated when
they connect to the daemon and what restrictions should be enforced on
the clients actions (such as joining groups or sending messages).
Second, it inserts appropriate checks into Spread to enforce whatever
access control policy the user has enabled.
<p>
We have made a major step forward in our integrated
architecture with respect to the key management building block.
In this architecture, the key management block is moved from the
Secure Spread library to the Spread daemon itself. This also changes
the way the data is protected by means of encryption.
The Spread daemons share a key and based 
on it and additional information generate
group keys and refresh them after every group membership change.
The daemons key is changed upon daemon membership changes.

We finalized
the design of three different solutions of providing confidentiality
of the data, supporting two group communication semantics: Virtual
Synchrony and Extended Virtual Synchrony. These solutions are:
<ul>
<li> Virtual Synchrony solution: provides the client with a Virtual
Synchrony model, similar to the current layered Secure Spread
implementation. It has the advantage, compared with the layered
architecture, that key agreement protocol is required on every network
connectivity change and not every join and leave of a client. Client
joins and leave only require a local computation at each of the
daemons that have relevant clients.
<li> Extended Virtual Synchrony solution: provides the client with the
more efficient Extended Virtual Synchrony model. We are protecting the
data between the client and the daemon using a client-daemon key that
is generated upon connect. The drawback of this method is that every
message will be encrypted three times and deciphered three time
(client -> daemon) (daemon -> daemons) (daemon -> client).
<li> Optimized Extended Virtual Synchrony solution: similar to the
above but in most cases encrypt and decipher the message only
once. Only in messages that are sent just before a daemon connectivity
change there will be a need for the messages to be deciphered and
re-encrypted by the daemons. This solution provides a considerable
performance boost, but is fairly complex to implement.
</ul>

<p>
We started the implementation of these solutions. 
We are on our way to complete an implementation of the Virtual Synchrony solution and
implemented the building blocks for the Extended Virtual Synchrony
solution. The Extended Virtual Synchrony code was merged with the
main development tree and is currently going under internal testing and evaluation.
In addition, we designed a flexible architecture that will allow 
us to provide all the solutions in a configurable way.

Group key agreement is a fundamental building block for secure peer
group communication systems. Several group key agreement protocols
were proposed in the last decade, all of them assuming the existence
of an underlying group communication infrastructure.
<br><br>
This paper presents a performance evaluation of five notable key
agreement protocols for peer groups, integrated with a reliable group
communication system (Spread). They are: Centralized Group Key
Distribution (CKD), Burmester-Desmedt (BD), Steer et al. (STR), Group
Diffie-Hellman (GDH) and Tree-Based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH).  The
paper includes an in-depth comparison and analysis of conceptual
results and is the first to report practical results in real-life
local and wide area networks. Our analysis of these protocols'
experimental results offers insights into their scalability and
practicality.

<h3><font color="blue">Software:</font></h3>
<p> <b>Spread</b> releases:
<ul>
<p><li>We released Spread 3.13 in August 2000. The main new features of
this version included:
<ul>
<li> Scalability improvements in the number of groups in the system.
The lightweight group management is now using probablistic algorithms
that reduce group lookups to complexity of o(log(n)) down from o(n).
This allows us to support tens of thousands of groups without
noticeable performance penalty.  Our system is still limited to about
1000 groups due to state transfer implementation limitation.  <li>
Performance improvements for small messages (by a factor of 4 or so).
<li> A new configuration format that allows improved run time
configuration.
</ul>
<li>
We have released Spread 3.14 (October 31, 2000), 3.15.0 (December 20,
2000), 3.15.1 (February 26, 2001), and 3.15.2 (March 20, 2001) during
this period.  These releases address stability issues discovered by
the growing community of Spread users.

<li>
A release of Spread, 3.16.0 (June 25, 2001), that includes a
preliminary version of an integrated authentication and access control
enforcement framework. We also have released several updates to Spread 3.16.0.

<li>
We have released <a href="http://www.spread.org">Spread</a> version 3.16.1 on
December 2001.
<li>
We have released <a href="http://www.spread.org">Spread</a> version 3.16.2 in
April 2002.

</ul>

<p> <b>Secure Spread</b> releases from the begining of the project:
<ul>
<li>We released Secure Spread Beta 0 in November 2000. This is a
preliminary version which includes a fairly stable API and a correct
implementation of the CLIQUES GDH key agreement protocol.  Secure
Spread beta 0 supports simple group events and failure scenarios.  No
cascading failures are supported.  This version is available for other
researchers to use.  It works with Spread 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14.
<li>
We released Secure Spread Version 1.0 in March 2001. This version
included a complete robust CLIQUES GDH protocol and a stable API for
establishing secure groups and sending and receiving encrypted
messages.  This version is available and works with Spread 3.12, 3.13,
3.14, and 3.16.0.
<li>
This year we have released  <a href="http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/research/group/secure_spread/">Secure Spread</a> version 2.0 in
February 2002, which includes all of the key agreement protocols we will exepriment with during this project.
