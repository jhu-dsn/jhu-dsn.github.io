<h3><font color="blue">Progress:</font></h3>

During this timeframe, we continued our work on both the
experimantation conducted by BBN Technologies and SRI International
and on the development and release of a major secure architecture for
Spread: an integrated architecture. The goal of this architecture is
to amortize the cost of the key agreement protocols over many groups
and to provide very fast joins and leaves, while ensuring the
confidentiality of the data even when long-term keys of the
participant get compromised.

Our contribution to the RedTeam effort on the Secure Spread project
consisted of: participating in weekly teleconferences, providing
feedback on the experimentation documents, answering technical
questions and providing fixes when necessary.

<p>
Our main research effort concentrated on the development of an
integrated architecture for Spread. Our solution describes three
variants, that trade-off group communication model for performance. As
part of the experimentation plan, we provided an internal release of
an integrated architecture variant for BBN Technologies.

<p>
We conducted a presentation and demonstration of Secure Spread, both
layered architecture and a preliminary version of the integrated
architecture, in Hawai for Pacific Command.

<p>
We also participated in the DARPA DISCEX 3 Conference. Secure Spread
was featured in the movie promoting all the technologies from the
DARPA programs, and our group was present both in the presentations
section and in the Exposition.

  This paper develops several integrated security architecture
  scenarios for client-server group communication systems. In an
  integrated architecture, security services are implemented in
  servers, in contrast to a layered architecture where the same
  services are implemented in clients.  We discuss benefits and
  drawbacks of each proposed architecture and present experimental
  results that demonstrate the superior scalability of an integrated
  architecture.

<h3><font color="blue">Software:</font></h3>

So far, we registered about 500 downloads for Secure Spread from our
web site and about 6000 for Spread.

<h3><font color="blue">Plans for Next Quarter:</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> Continue support of the experimentation and red team effort.
<li> Continue the work on the integrated architecture.
<li> Update the integrated access control and authentication framework based on community feedback.
<li> Continue research into high performance wide area group communication.
</ul>
