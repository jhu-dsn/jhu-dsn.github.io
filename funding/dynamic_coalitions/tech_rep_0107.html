<h3><font color="blue">Objective:</font></h3>

A practical group communication system should provide secure multicast services for peer
groups over local and wide area networks. To support the environment described in the Dynamic
Coalition program, such a system should scale to tens of coalition parties, with hundreds of
servers, supporting thousands of users. This service is crucial for building distributed
applications that work in dynamic environments and communicate over unsecured networks (e.g.
the Internet). It is also important for enabling other infrastructures for these environments,
such as replicated certification, highly available policy management, and high performance
access control.
<p>
A common claim today is that a wide-area, secure group communication system with strict
reliability semantics and strict security requirements, cannot perform well enough to be
practical. Based on our past and current work, we claim that with careful protocol design, a
system that is limited to the size of the above peer groups can perform well without relaxing
any of the security or reliability guarantees. The objective of this project is to build it.

<h3><font color="blue">Accomplishments:</font></h3>

Our research plan calls for the concurrent development of two architectures.
The layered architecture layers our security mechanisms on top of the guarantees
of the group communication system. This significantly simplifies the design and
allows us to experiment with different approaches quickly. This work translates
to a client library we call Secure Spread.
<br>
<br>
The integrated architecture integrates the security mechanisms into the group 
communication system. This approach is much more scalable as it dramatically
amortizes the cost of providing security so that costly operations only happen
when the network connectivity changes and not as a result of client-initiated 
actions. The tradeoff is in an increased development complexity. This work translates
to versions of the Spread toolkit that come with built-in security.

The rational behind this two-tracks approach is that it allows us to experiments
with many protocols before we decide what to include (for a heavy development price)
inside the group communication toolkit.

<p>
<b>Layered architecture</b>
<p>
We started by implementing Secure Spread 0.0.3, providing a key 
agreement protocol based on the CLIQUES Group Diffie-Helman (GDH) algorithm. 
The protocol did not support cascaded failures. This first version was
released at November 2000.
<br><br>
We then worked on providing a fault-tolerant protocol. We designed the first 
robust contributory key agreement protocol based on CLIQUES GDH and proved its 
correctness. This robust protocol formed the core of Secure Spread 1.0.0, a version
we released at March 2001. A technical
report presenting two robust algorithms and their corectness is available below.
This work was presented at the 2001 IEEE International Conference on 
Distributed Computing Systems held in Phoenix, Arizona during April.
<br><br>
We have also finalized the design of a new robust Tree-based Group 
Diffie-Helman algorithm. The primitives that allow building the protocol
were implemented within the CLIQUES TGDH library. A paper describing this 
work was presented at the 2000 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications 
Security (CCS-8) held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during November.
<br><br>
A new group key agreement method (STR), based on a protocol originally proposed 
by Steer et al. at Crypto88, was specified and implemented as part 
of the CLIQUES STR library. This work was presented at IFIP-SEC 2001 in June.
<br><br>
We created a unified framework in Secure Spread that enabled us to evaluate 
and compare the different key agreement algorithms side by side, namely, 
Centralized Key Distribution (CKD), CLIQUES Group Diffie Helman (GDH), 
Tree-based Group Diffie Helman (TGDH), Burmester-Desmedt (BD), and STR.
<br><br>
We worked on designing and integrating with Secure Spread four more key 
agreement protocols (in addition to GDH):
<ol>
<li>CKD: we implemented the 'vanilla' cases for evaluation purposes. 
<li>BD : we designed and implemented a robust protocol based on the 
         BD algorithm.
<li>TGDH: we finished the design of a robust protocol based on TGDH 
          and we implemented the 'vanilla' cases for performance 
          evaluation purposes.  
<li>STR: we finished the design of a robust protocol based on STR and 
         we implemented the 'vanilla' cases for performance evaluation 
         purposes.
</ol>

Preliminary results on the performance evaluation of above five key agreement protocols 
were presented in the Dynamic Coalition PI Meeting at Colarado Springs USA in July. 
We plan to make these protocols available in our next release of Secure Spread.
</p>

<p>
<b>Integrated architecture</b>
<p>
We integrated a global flow control algorithm for multi-sender 
multi-group multicast in wide area overlay networks. 
This is a very important step toward practical high performance wide area group
communication.

<p>
We defined the necessary services for practical secure group communication 
in particular and for overlay networks in general. We looked beyond the key 
agreement protocols into authentication and access control mechanisms. 
<br><br>
We completed the initial design of a framework for access control in group
communication systems. This framework specifies a modular architecture 
allowing multiple access control and authentication protocols to be used 
and the location of checks in the group communication system to enforce 
the policies. 
<br><br>
The access control and authentication framework adds two new features to 
the Spread group communication system. First, it provides a modular API 
that allows anyone to write a custom authentication and access control 
policy code module which will be loaded into the Spread daemon. This 
module (or modules) will control how clients are authenticated when they 
connect to the daemon and what restrictions should be enforced on the 
clients' actions (such as joining groups or sending messages).  Second, 
it inserts appropriate checks into Spread to enforce whatever access 
control policy the user has enabled.
<br><br>
We implemented the framework in the Spread Group Communication System 
version 3.16. A technical report describing the architecture along with 
some examples of authentication methods that are supported by the framework 
is available. This work will be presented in the Third International 
Workshop on Networked Group Communications at London, UK in November.

<h3><font color="blue">Current Plan:</font></h3>

Our plan for FY 2002 includes the following:
<ul>
<li> Explore and analyze the difficulties in dynamic control and reconfiguration of group communication
systems. Begin the design of efficient and correct protocols for this environment.

<li> Work with several other Dynamic Coalition groups to evaluate which software components would
be suitable to integrate with Secure Spread. 

<li> The initial implementation of an Integrated architecture: The implementation will include
fault-tolerant protocols that implement shared keys, optimized per-group keys, and use the keys to 
provide core security services. The focus of this work will be a prototype upon which performance
and correctness evaluation can be done, including a comparison with the layered architecture.

<li>The research of new group trust models and an API: Development of the algorithms that
compute the overall trust of a group based on individual members' respect for other members.
Design of an API that exports the individual and group trust status.

<li> The release of a new Secure Spread library, 
the second release based on the new architecture and protocols developed in this project. 
</ul>

            Most prior research   in group key management focused on minimizing
computational overhead   stemming from expensive cryptographic operations whereas bandwidth and communication round complexity was of secondary concern. However, recent advances in computation have resulted in the network delay in wide area networks (WANs) being the primary cost factor in the performance of group key management protocols. In this paper, we reconsider a group key agreement protocol previously  proposed by Steer, et al. in 1988. We extend it to handle dynamic groups and network faults such as topology partitions and merges. The resulting protocol suite is simple, provably secure, fault-tolerant, and particularly well-suited for applications in high-delay WANs.

<h3><font color="blue">Software:</font></h3>

<p>We released Spread 3.13 in August 2000. The main new features of this 
version included: 
<ul>
<li> Scalability improvements in the number of groups in the system. 
The lightweight group management is now using probablistic algorithms that reduce 
group lookups to complexity of o(log(n)) down from o(n). 
This allows us to support tens of thousands of groups without noticeable performance penalty.
Our system is still limited to about 1000 groups due to state transfer implementation limitation.
<li> Performance improvements for small messages (by a factor of 4 or so).
<li> A new configuration format that allows improved run time configuration.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We released Secure Spread Beta 0 in November 2000. This is a 
preliminary version which includes a fairly stable API and 
a correct implementation of the CLIQUES GDH key agreement protocol. 
Secure Spread beta 0 supports simple group events and failure scenarios.
No cascading failures are supported.
This version is available for other researchers to use. 
It works with Spread 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14.
</p>

<p>
We released Secure Spread Version 1.0 in March 2001. This version included 
a complete robust CLIQUES GDH protocol and a stable API for establishing 
secure groups and sending and receiving encrypted messages. 
This version is available and works with Spread 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, and 3.16.0.
</p>

<p>
We have released Spread 3.14 (October 31, 2000), 3.15.0 (December 20, 2000), 
3.15.1 (February 26, 2001), and 3.15.2 (March 20, 2001) during this period. 
These releases address stability issues discovered by the growing community 
of Spread users. 
</p>

<p>
A release of Spread, 3.16.0 (June 25, 2001), that includes a preliminary 
version of an integrated authentication and access control enforcement 
framework. 
</p>

<h3><font color="blue">Technology Transfer:</font></h3>
<p>
We know of one Dynamic Coaltions project that already uses our software: 
This is the Efficient and Scalable Infrastructure Support project done at 
Johns Hopkins and Brown, which aims to provide scalable certification service.
We are exploring potential collaboration with other projects in the program.
</p>

<p>
During the period Spread was integrated into the beta version of OpenLinux. 
It was released in the next OpenLinux version in June.
</p>

<p>
A Spread Workshop was held over three days at Johns Hopkins University in June 2001. 
This meeting included people from academia and industry and involved 
presentations, demos, and a collaborative discussion of 
future features, current needs and problems, and solutions.
