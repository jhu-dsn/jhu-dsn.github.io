           This paper presents a performance evaluation of five
           notable key agreement protocols for peer groups, integrated
           with a reliable group communication system (Spread). They
           are: Centralized Group Key Distribution (CKD),
           Burmester-Desmedt (BD), Steer et al. (STR), Group
           Diffie-Hellman (GDH) and Tree-Based Group Diffie-Hellman
           (TGDH).  The paper includes an in-depth comparison and
           analysis of conceptual results and is the first to report
           practical results in real-life local and wide area
           networks. Our analysis of these protocols' experimental
           results offers insights into their scalability and
           practicality.

	    Most prior research in group key management focused on
            minimizing computational overhead stemming from expensive
            cryptographic operations whereas bandwidth and
            communication round complexity was of secondary
            concern. However, recent advances in computation have
            resulted in the network delay in wide area networks (WANs)
            being the primary cost factor in the performance of group
            key management protocols. In this paper, we reconsider a
            group key agreement protocol previously proposed by Steer,
            et al. in 1988. We extend it to handle dynamic groups and
            network faults such as topology partitions and merges. The
            resulting protocol suite is simple, provably secure,
            fault-tolerant, and particularly well-suited for
            applications in high-delay WANs.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>

A practical group communication system should provide secure multicast services for peer groups
over local and wide area networks. To support the environment described in the Dynamic Coalition
program, such a system should scale to tens of coalition parties, with hundreds of servers,
supporting thousands of users. This service is crucial for building distributed applications that
work in dynamic environments and communicate over unsecured networks (e.g. the Internet). It is
also important for enabling other infrastructures for these environments, such as replicated
certification, highly available policy management, and high performance access control.
A common claim is that a wide-area, secure group communication system with strict
reliability semantics and strict security requirements cannot perform well enough to be
practical. Therefore, some research is focused on different ways to relax either the security or
the reliability requirements (or both). Based on our past and current work, we claim that with
careful protocol design, a system that is limited to the size of the above peer groups can perform
well without relaxing any of the security or reliability guarantees. This project enables us to built it.
<h3>Key innovations</h3>
<ul>
<li> Constructing group communication protocols that support wide and local area networks with tens 
of sites, hundreds of servers, and thousands of users.
<p>
<li> Current key agreement protocols are not designed to tolerate failures and changes in the
membership during their execution. Our protocols, in contrast, will be completely resilient to any
sequence of such events. We believe this will be the first robust implementation of distributed
key agreement protocols that provide perfect forward secrecy, group membership authentication,
non-repudiation, and resilience to known-key attacks.
? The performance of a group key generation protocol is very dependent on the network structure,
the relative power of machines, and the algorithm used. We do not think that there can be one key
agreement protocol that outperforms all other protocols in all of the possible environments.
Instead, we will develop several different algorithms, each optimized  (performance-wise) for a
different setting.
<p>
<li> We will design and build a modular architecture that allows different security protocols to be
plugged in. The architecture will switch protocols during execution in agreement with other
members, so that the most suitable protocol for the current situation is invoked. The selection
will be based on the current state of the network, available system resources, the number of
members in the group, a user defined policy, etc.
<p>
<li> The current state of the art in secure group communication implements security as a layer,
separate from the reliability, ordering, and membership services. Although this structure has much
merit, there is a high performance cost attached. We will build two versions of our system that
share most of the code and infrastructure. The Layered Architecture version will have the security
services provided on top of the reliability, ordering and membership services. The Integrated
Architecture version will tailor the security protocols into the core reliability, ordering and
membership services, drastically cutting the latency and bandwidth cost associated with group
membership changes.
<p>
<li> In a Dynamic Coalition environment, it is likely that each coalition party will retain its
autonomy, which includes full control over its part of the infrastructure. This is in contrast to
current group communication architectures that assume one administrative domain. Our system will
allow multiple autonomous control domains, while still preserving the tightly coupled group
communication semantics.
<p>
<li> Our system will incorporate a new trust model and "trust ranking" algorithms, combining mutual
respect values of group members into a consistent global trust vector. This vector is continuously
updated in a distributed fashion as a result of ongoing interactions between members. The trust
vector affects the allocation of resources in the group (who can multicast, how much), the
selection of security protocols used, the admission/eviction of members, and other privileges.
