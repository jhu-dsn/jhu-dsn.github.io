<h2>Quarterly Technical Report, October 2001</h2>

<h3><font color="blue">Progress:</font></h3>
During the past three months we have completed the design and
implementation of our unifying framework that allows us to include
different key agreement protocols in the Secure Spread framework. We
also completed an implementation of three new key agreement protocols
and added them to the system.  As a result, the Secure Spread system
now support five key agreement protocols:
<ul>
<li> BD (Burmester Desmedt) - a protocol that requires three rounds
and upto n multicasts in each round, and is fairly easy to make it
robust.
<li> CKD (Centralized Key Distribution) - a protocol that selects a
leader based on the membership of a group and that leader computes a
key and disseminates it to the others.
<li> GDH (Group Diffie Hellman) - our basic CLIQUES protocol.
<li> STR - A sparse tree group Diffie Hellman.
<li> TGDH (Tree-based Group Diffie Hellman).
</ul>
<p>
We have experimented with the five different protocols over a local
area network. 
<p>
We completed an initial implementation of our access control framework
which is part of our integrated architecture.  This framework
specifies a modular architecture allowing multiple access control and
authentication protocols to be used and the location of checks in the
group communication system to enforce the policies.  The access
control and authentication framework adds two new features to the
Spread group communication system. First, it provides a modular API
that allows anyone to write a custom authentication and access control
policy code module which will be loaded into the Spread daemon. This
module (or modules) will control how clients are authenticated when
they connect to the daemon and what restrictions should be enforced on
the clients actions (such as joining groups or sending messages).
Second, it inserts appropriate checks into Spread to enforce whatever
access control policy the user has enabled.
<p>
We have made a major step forward in the design of our integrated
architecture with respect to the key management building block.
In the integrated architecture, this building block is moved
from the Secure Spread library to the Spread daemon itself.
The Spread daemons share a key and based 
on it and additional information generate
group keys and refresh them after every group membership change.
The daemons key is changed upon daemon membership changes.

We have devised three types of solutions to obtain a shared
daemon key, depending on where and how encryption is done and what 
group communication model is used:
<ul>
<li> Virtual Synchrony solution: provides the client with a Virtual
Synchrony model, similar to the current layered Secure Spread
implementation. It has the advantage, compared with the layered
architecture, that key agreement protocol is required on every network
connectivity change and not every join and leave of a client. Client
joins and leave only require a local computation at each of the
daemons that have relevant clients.
<li> Extended Virtual Synchrony solution: provides the client with the
more efficient Extended Virtual Synchrony model. We are protecting the
data between the client and the daemon using a client-daemon key that
is generated upon connect. The drawback of this method is that every
message will be encrypted three times and deciphered three time
(client -> daemon) (daemon -> daemons) (daemon -> client).
<li> Optimized Extended Virtual Synchrony solution: similar to the
above but in most cases encrypt and decipher the message only
once. Only in messages that are sent just before a daemon connectivity
change there will be a need for the messages to be deciphered and
re-encrypted by the daemons. This solution provides a considerable
performance boost, but is fairly complex to implement.
</ul>
<p>
We were fortunate to host the Program Manager Dr. Douglas Maughan during this period. During the visit we demonstrated the Secure Spread system in action and
live nation-wide experiments with Spread.

<h3><font color="blue">Software:</font></h3>

We have released several updates to Spread 3.16.0, but no major
release this time around.

<h3><font color="blue">Technology Transfer:</font></h3>

We know of one Dynamic Coalitions project that already uses our
software: This is the Efficient and Scalable Infrastructure Support
project done at University of California, Irvine and at Brown
University, which aims to provide scalable certification service.
<p>
We are starting to get some comments from the community regarding
issues with the Secure Spread release, which means that at least some
people are exploring it.
<p>

<h3><font color="blue">Plans for Next Quarter:</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> Experiment with the key agreement protocols supported by our
framework on wide area networks.  Continue to explore the different
trade-offs of the different key agreement protocols as they manifest
themselves on local and wide area networks.
<li> Continue our work on the integrated architecture.
<li> Update the integrated access control and authentication framework
based on community feedback.
<li> Continued research into high performance wide area group
communication.
</ul>
