	    <br>
	    <small>Technical Report CNDS-2001-1
	    by Yair Amir, Baruch Awerbuch, Claudiu Danilov and Jonathan Stanton
            <br>	
	    We present a protocol
	    that is analytically grounded, yet also achieves real world goals,
	    such as simplicity, fairness and minimal resource usage.  We base our
	    flow control protocol on the Cost-Benefit algorithmic framework for
	    resource management. We base decisions on the "opportunity" costs of
	    network resources, comparing the cost of each individual resource to
	    the benefit it provides.  As opposed to existing window-based flow
	    control schemes, we avoid end-to-end feedback by basing decisions on
	    the state of the links between participating nodes. This produces
	    control traffic proportional only to the number of overlay network
	    links and independent of the number of groups.

	     This
	     paper presents the design of the transport protocols of the Spread
	     wide area group communication system. We focus on two aspects of the
	     system. First, the value of using overlay networks for application
	     level group communication services. Second, the requirements and
	     design of effective low latency link protocols used to construct
	     wide area group communication.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This project develop the theory and algorithms required to overcome extremely strong network
attacks, while providing theoretically provable performance bounds. We are building a system
that incorporates these algorithms, and that exhibits good performance in practice.

<h3>Key innovations</h3>
<ul>
<li> <I>Analysis of strong adversary models:</I> In order to understand how robust our solutions must
be, we need to first understand what is the model of possible attacks and errors. We introduce a collection of adversary models. They range from a simple predictable
slow adversary, to a somewhat limited "stable path" adversary (which allows communication over
a path to be successfully completed), to a totally unpredictable adversary (which can
selectively block traffic based on type, source, destination, etc.). Many of these models have
not been considered in the literature so far.
<p>
<li> <I>New routing and dissemination protocols:</I> We design a suite of novel routing protocols
tailored to the above adversary models and prove that these protocols perform in a
near-optimal manner. Specifically, our solution, in case an operational
path exists, will be able to select such a path with high probability and, in case such a path
does not exist, will store and forward the packets. The performance and correctness properties
of these protocols will be supported by rigorous analysis. Our analysis will not assume
anything about either the topology or the traffic patterns in the network, and will not assume
a known correlation between past and future behavior of the adversary.
<p>
<li> <I>New replication protocols:</I> When there is no information-theoretic possibility of
communication, say in the case of a cut in the network, one can still continue the operation
by making sure that the data is replicated in most areas, or at least in the areas where
disconnection is likely. We design a suite of replication protocols that can handle a range
of adversaries and can gracefully degrade performance and semantics as the network hostility
increases.
<p>
<li> <I>A Cost-Benefit decision framework:</I> This framework is used to select the most suitable
protocol as network conditions change, both for network-level protocols such as routing and
dissemination, and data-level protocols such as replication. The main idea is to consider the
marginal benefit obtained by the application when consuming a given resource, versus the
"opportunity cost" of using this resource. The latter is the benefit that may potentially be
lost by other applications if this resource is committed. In the network level, the decision
is based on application tolerance to delay, and the reliability of the network. In the data
level, the decision is based on the cost of inaccessibility of data, the cost of updating
replicas, and the synchronization cost of replication.
<p>
<li> <I>An overlay network architecture:</I> We rely on an overlay network architecture that makes
these protocols practical since they are too complex to have any hope to be implemented in
general Internet routers anytime soon.
