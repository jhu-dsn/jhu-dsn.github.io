<h3><font color="blue">Progress:</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Analysis of strong adversary models: We investigated an adversary that 
can fail and recover edges in an arbitrary manner, in contrast to
traditional adversary models which leave the network stable for time 
long enough for the protocols to accomplish global communication.
<p>
<li>New routing and dissemination protocols: We devised initial routing 
protocols that accomplish the task of routing facing the above strong 
adversary model. Our protocols operate without using the concept of
a global path, which is standard in the common "weak adversary" models.
Moreover, the operation of these protocols is based solely on locally
available knowledge, eliminating the need to build a global picture of
the network state.
<p>
<li>New replication protocol: We have developed a general replication engine 
that allows consistent ordering of actions in a network that is prone to 
partitions and crashes.
The main idea has several instances of the engine (several tens) strategically
positioned in the network. The replicas maintain consistent state and recover
from a wide range of possible faults.  
The engine software is now going through testing and evaluation.
<p>
We have built some of the infrastructure that will allow us to test the 
replication engine, inducing faults into practical network settings. 
Currently, our tests are still configned to our lab.
<p>
<li>Overlay networks architecture: We started developing the basic building 
blocks for our overlay networks architecture. The first step was to develop 
Hop - a link level modified selective-repeat protocol that is TCP-fair, uses less CPU, and allows us full control over the forwarding of messages on 
the overlay network.
<p>
We designed two alternative global flow control schemes. The first scheme is
a cost benefit approach to buffer utilization in the overlay network routers. The second Scheme is a cost benefit approach to capacity utilization of the 
overlay links. We are still investigating the tradeoffs between these schemes.
<p>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Plans for Next Quarter:</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> Network level resiliency: We plan to analyze specific techniques 
for single-source single-destination routing, and develop efficient 
routing methods for the weak adversary model. We expect that the final 
protocol will achieve performance comparable to algoritms that operate 
with global knowledge of current and future adversarial behavior.
<p>
<li> Data level resiliency: We plan to continue the validation of our 
general replication engine. We intend to use the CAIRN network to experiment 
with high latency wide area settings. Next, we plan to integrate the 
replication engine to an open source database, probably postgres or MySql. 
<p>
In addition, we plan to investigate building a global resilient file system 
as the first test case for data level resiliency. We will investigate building
it on top of our replication engine to provide strict semantics for file 
access. This will go beyond the next quarter.
<p>
<li> Cost benefit decision making: We will continue developing the cost 
benefit framework to support global flow control on our overlay network 
architecture. We plan to investigate extending the cost benefit framework 
to support overlay network routing.
<p>
<li> Overlay network infrastructure: Our goal is to complete the global flow 
control mechanisms in our overlay network architecture. This will allow 
efficient dissemination of data that adapts to network conditions.
