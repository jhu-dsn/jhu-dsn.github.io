<h2>Quarterly Technical Report, April 2003</h2>
<p>
<h3><font color="blue">Progress:</font></h3>

This quarter we continued our work on the Spines overlay network infrastructure
and on the Wackamole NxWay failover for servers and routers.

<ul>
<li> The Spines overlay network infrastructure.

<p>
We designed a framework for application level, transparent reliable multicast
using the hop-by-hop reliability in Spines. The framework includes end-to-end 
reliablility, congestion and flow control, and relaxed semantics over reliable 
multicast that handle partitions, merges, crashes and recoveries. We started 
the implementation of this framework in our overlay infrastructure.
<p>
We investigated some of the survivability aspects of Spines, both in wireless
and wired environments. We developed a mechanism of trust based on monitoring 
the abnormal behaviour of overlay nodes, and an acusation system that would 
eventually reroute packets to avoid untrusted nodes.

We released the first version of Spines (<a href="http://www.spines.org">www.spines.org</a>)
under a standard BSD licence. 

<li> Wackamole: N-Way fail-over infrastructure for servers and routers.
<p>
We have evaluated Wackamole's performance varying the number of servers in the cluster
and adapting the latencies of the Spread toolkit to optimize performance.
We are able to achieve NxWay failover in a cluster within 12 seconds using 
the standard timeouts of the Spread toolkit. This is improved to under 2 seconds using 
a tuned version of Spread, that fits non-congested local area networks.
We have specified the Wackamole algorithm and proved its correctness, which
can be found in the technical report below.

<p>
Reliable point-to-point communication is usually achieved in overlay
networks by applying TCP/IP on the end nodes of a connection.
This paper presents an hop-by-hop reliability approach that
considerably reduces the latency and jitter of reliable connections.
Our approach is feasible and beneficial in overlay networks that
do not have the scalability and interoperability requirements of
the global Internet.
<br><br>
The effects of the hop-by-hop reliability approach are quantified
in simulation as well as in practice using a newly developed
overlay network software that is fair with the external traffic 
on the Internet. The experimental results show that
the overhead associated with overlay network processing at the
application level does not play an important factor compared with
the considerable gain of the approach.

Maintaining the availability of critical servers and routers is an important
concern for many organizations. At the lowest level, IP addresses represent the
global namespace by which services are accessible on the Internet.
<p>
We introduce Wackamole, a completely distributed software solution
based on a provably correct algorithm that negotiates the
assignment of IP addresses among the currently available servers upon
detection of faults. This reallocation ensures that at any given time
any public IP address of the server cluster is covered exactly once,
as long as at least one physical server survives the network fault.
The same technique is extended to support highly available routers. 
<p>
The paper presents the design considerations, 
algorithm specification and correctness proof, discusses
the practical usage for server clusters and for routers,
and evaluates the performance of the system.

<h3><font color="blue">Software:</font></h3>

We released the first version of Spines (<a href="http://www.spines.org">www.spines.org</a>)
under a standard BSD licence. The current version offers both best-effort and reliable
communication, obtaining better performance for reliable sessions in an overlay network setup,
compared with the end-to-end reliable communication.
<p>


We have released <a href="http://www.wackamole.org">Wackamole</a> version 2.0.0 in
November 2002. The system is supported now under Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris 8, and MacOS-X.
One of the main improvements is the new support for NxWay fail-over for routers.
So far, we have registered over 800 downloads of the software from our web site.
<br>

<h3><font color="blue">Plans for Next Quarter:</font></h3>
Our focus for the next quarter will be on providing reliable multicast
functionality in overlay networks, and add survivabilty features to our overlay 
network platform.
