<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
<!-- Cloud computing presents a new, cost effective approach to run the nation's IT infrastructure. This paradigm
shift means that the global IT infrastructure becomes dependent on a relatively small number of very large
distributed systems managed as clouds, and the trend will likely continue as a result of the economic benefits
of scale. Availability, reliability and security are paramount in this new world. In our experience, in order
for a cloud to achieve adequate scale and availability, consistent global state replicated across the network 
and a distributed messaging system that connects cloud componenets are mandatory. However, a large gap in the
cloud architecture is its vulnerability to intrusions. Modern cloud systems entail a large concentration of 
homogeneous hosts on the widely accessible Internet. With essentially the same software running on each of 
these hosts, the ability to compromise one cloud node usually translates to the capacity to take over the 
entire system. The implicit trust among hosts and lack of strong internal checks make matters worse.
The algorithms and tools needed to build consistent global state and a distributed messaging system that
work well under sophisticated intrusion attacks do not exist in practice. Therefore, 
our goal in this project is to invent, develop and transition the replication and overlay messaging tools
necessary to make public and private clouds resilient to sophisticated intrusion attacks. The proposed
plan consists of: -->

Cloud computing offers a new, cost-effective approach for running the nation's
IT infrastructure. As critical services move to a relatively small number of
large distributed systems, ensuring the availability, reliability, and security
of those systems becomes essential. Our experience has shown that a scalable,
highly-available cloud system requires consistent replicated global state and a
distributed messaging system that connects the cloud components. However, there
is a large gap between today's cloud systems and a truly resilient cloud
architecture; this gap is the vulnerability to intrusions. The systems in use
today were not designed to withstand sophisticated attackers who may
successfully compromise one or more machines in the system. Modern cloud
systems are generally composed of homogeneous hosts on the widely accessible
Internet. Because these systems are on the Internet, they are subject to
attack. However, today's systems typically rely on perimeter defenses and
implicitly trust all hosts in the system; an attacker who is able to gain
access to a single host can cause serious damage throughout the system.
Moreover, the homogeneity of the hosts means that the same exploit will be
effective against all of them, so even if hosts are not implicitly trusted, a
determined attacker can compromise a large fraction of the system and do
considerable damage. A resilient cloud must continue to function correctly and
perform well under sophisticated attacks, including when the system is
partially compromised. However, the algorithms and tools needed to build
consistent global state and distributed messaging systems that meet this
requirement do not exist in practice. Our goal in this project is to invent,
develop, and transition the replication and messaging tools necessary to make
public and private clouds resilient to sophisticated intrusion attacks. The
proposed plan includes:

<ul>
<li> Developing the first scalable, intrusion-tolerant replication protocol that provides performance
guarantees under attack, including extremely sophisticated intrusions.
<li> Developing the first scalable tunable intrusion-tolerant overlay messaging engine, containing two
new sets of protocols: Controlled Authenticated K-Paths Routing and Controlled Authenticated Flooding.
<ul>
<li> Controlled Authenticated K-Paths Routing: routes a message from source to destination along
K node-disjoint paths, providing protection against up to K-1 compromised nodes, while incurring a cost that
is K times the cost of standard secure link-state routing.
<li> Controlled Authenticated Flooding: provides optimal intrusion tolerance -- if there is even a single
path of correct nodes from source to destination, the message will arrive.
</ul>
<li> Developing automated diversity to be incorporated with the replication and messaging engines, providing
each of their instances in the cloud network with a diverse attack surface. 
<li> Developing a detection, diagnosis and prediction engine that will use cloud entities' log streams to 
allow real time detection and prediction of faults and attacks.
<li> Implementing the previously mentioned components into a real cloud system running on the wide-area network.
</ul>

<h3>Results and Current Activities</h3> 

<ul>

<li> We have designed a Controlled Authenticated K-Paths routing protocol, and
two Controlled Authenticated Flooding protocols. The first flooding protocol is
Priority Flooding with Source-Based Fairness, which is designed for cloud
monitoring and ensures that the most important messages from each source reach
their destination in a timely manner. The second is Reliable Flooding with
Flow-Based Reserved Capacity, which is designed for control messages and
ensures reliable message delivery.</li>

<li> We have implemented the K-Paths routing algorithm and the two flooding
algorithms in the existing <a href='http://www.spines.org'>Spines</a>
framework.</li>

<li> We have tested the K-Paths routing algorithm and the flooding algorithms
on both a simulated network and a real cloud overlay network.</li>

<li> We have developed a practical, survivable, intrusion-tolerant replication
engine by integrating the <a
href='http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/byzrep/prime.html'>Prime</a> replication system,
which provides performance guarantees under attack, with compiler-based
diversification that allows each replica to run different version of the
software. Moreover, replicas are periodically rejuvenated as part of  a
proactive recovery protocol, and each replica generates a new, diverse version
of the software upon rejuvenation. The compiler-based diversification is
provided by the <a
href='https://ssllab.org/trac/wiki/MultiCompilerPublic'>MultiCompiler</a>
developed by Michael Franz's group at University of California, Irvine.</li>

<li>We have developed theoretical results concerning the placement of limited
numbers of diverse variants (e.g. different operating systems) within a system.
