        <p><b>Spire</b> is an open-source intrusion-tolerant
        SCADA system for the power grid. Spire is designed to withstand attacks
        and compromises at both the system level and the network level, while
        meeting the timeliness requirements of power grid monitoring and
        control systems at the control center level (on the order of 100-200ms
        update latency).</p>
        <p>The Spire system includes a SCADA Master and PLC/RTU proxy
        designed from scratch to support intrusion tolerance, as well as
        several example HMIs based on <a
        href="https://pvbrowser.de/pvbrowser/index.php">pvbrowser</a>. The
        SCADA Master is replicated using the <a
        href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/prime/">Prime intrusion-tolerant
        replication engine</a>. Communication between Spire components is
        protected using the <a href="http://www.spines.org/">Spines
        intrusion-tolerant network</a>. The Spire PLC/RTU proxy can interact
        with any devices that use the Modbus or DNP3 communication protocols
        over IP. We use <a href="http://www.openplcproject.com/">OpenPLC</a> to
        emulate PLCs that can be monitored and controlled by the system.</p>

        <p>As the research progressed, Spire evolved into a toolkit with
        components that can support different deployment options, and that can
        provide intrusion-tolerance capabilities for power grid control systems
        at both control center and substation levels. Specifically, Spire 2.0
        release includes: Spire for the Substation and Confidential Spire in
        addition to the original base Spire.</p>

        <p><b>Confidential Spire</b> is an intrusion-tolerant SCADA system that
        provides the same resilience guarantees as the base Spire. However,
        Confidential Spire enables system operators to maintain strong
        confidentiality guarantees for potentially sensitive or proprietary
        system data, while still leveraging commodity data centers to support
        cost-effective network-attack resilience. In Confidential Spire, only
        replicas hosted in the control centers execute SCADA logic and process
        system updates. Data center replicas participate in the replication
        protocol, but only process and store encrypted state and updates. No
        application logic or unencrypted application data is exposed to the
        data center replicas</p>

        <p>Confidential Spire consists of the same modules as Spire (modified
        to support confidentiality). The main change is that Spire&#8217s standard
        SCADA master is replaced by the Confidential SCADA Master, which
        additionally performs the needed encryption/decryption of requests and
        state, along with generating threshold signatures on encrypted contents
        to prove their validity to data center replicas.</p>

        <p>Confidential Spire is described in the paper &#8220<a
        href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~babay/pubs/dsn21_confidentialBFT.pdf">Toward
        Intrusion Tolerance as a Service: Confidentiality in Partially
        Cloud-Based BFT Systems</a>&#8220 published at [<a

        <p><b>Spire for the Substation</b> is built to
        support the real-time Byzantine resilience required for power grid
        substations. The system is designed to withstand both system-level
        protective relay intrusions and network attacks on substation LAN,
        while meeting the stringent quarter of a power-cycle latency
        requirement (4.167ms).</p>

        <p>The Spire for the Substation includes a Trip Master, Relay Proxy and
        Breaker Proxy. Additionally, we provide emulated relays to simulate
        real substation fault-free and faulty operating conditions. We support
        substation communication protocol of IEC61850 using open-source
        libiec61850.</p>

        <p>Spire for the Substation is described in the paper &#8220<a

        Resilience for Power Grid Substations</a>&#8221 published at [<a

                <hr>
        
        <p>Spire 2.0 is the latest release. It extends the Spire 1.3 to support
        real-time Byzantine resilience of power grid substations. This release
        includes Spire for the Substation code that successfully withstood a
        red-team attack conducted by Sandia National Laboratories in an
        exercise at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in 2022.
        Furthermore, it includes Confidential Spire, a system that provides the
        same resilience guarantees as the base Spire. However, Confidential
        Spire enables system operators to maintain strong confidentiality
        guarantees for potentially sensitive or proprietary system data, while
        still leveraging commodity data centers to support cost-effective
        network-attack resilience. </p>

        <p>Spire 1.3 is the latest release. It updates Spire 1.2 to use Spines 5.5, OpenSSL 1.1.1 and includes a new ML-based <a href="nids/index.html">NIDS</a> (Network Intrusion Detection System) framework. This version of Spire uses Prime 3.3. </p>
        <p>Spire 1.2 updates Spire 1.1 to use Spines
        5.4, fixing a bug in Spines that could affect Spire in certain
        configurations. The Spire 1.1 release consists of the version of the
        Spire code that was used in a test deployment with the Hawaiian
        Electric Company (HECO) from January 22 to February 1, 2018. This test
        deployment was conducted by the <a href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/">DSN
        lab</a> and <a href="http://www.spreadconcepts.com/">Spread Concepts
        LLC</a> as part of a DoD ESTCP project led by <a
        href="http://www.resurgo.net/">Resurgo LLC</a>. This version of the
        code was deployed using Prime 3.1 and Spines 5.3.</p>

        <p>Spire 1.1 builds on the Spire 1.0 release, which consisted of the
        version of the Spire code that successfully withstood a red-team attack
        conducted by Sandia National Laboratories in an exercise at Pacific
        Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) from March 27 to April 7, 2017, as
        part of the same DoD ESTCP project. This version of the code was
        deployed using Prime 3.0 and Spines 5.2.</p>

        <p>Spire 1.1 supports six different example SCADA systems, with their associated HMIs:
        <ul>
        <li>jhu: an example system we created to represent a power distribution system
              with 10 substations, each monitored and controlled by a different PLC or RTU
        <li>pnnl: the exact system that was used in the red-team exercise at PNNL, where
              it monitored and controlled a real PLC provided by PNNL
        <li>heco_3breaker: the system that was deployed at the Hawaiian Electric Company,
              monitoring and controlling to a real PLC that controlled three physical
              breakers
        <li>heco_5breaker: a system similar to heco_3breaker but including two additional
              breakers
        <li>heco_timing: the system used at the Hawaiian Electric Company to measure the
              end-to-end response time of the system by flipping a breaker and measuring
              the time for the HMI to reflect the change
        <li>ems: a system modeling an Energy Management System (EMS) that controls
              several different types of generators with different ramp-up rates and
              renewable energy sources that can be connected to the grid or deactivated
        </ul></p>

        <p>The SCADA Master of Spire 1.1 can support all of these systems; we
        provide a separate HMI for each system. Note that because the pnnl and
        heco systems use the same underlying infrastructure, only one of the
        pnnl, heco_3breaker, heco5_breaker, and heco_timing systems can be run at
        once. However, any one of these systems can be simultaneously run with
        both the jhu and ems systems. We also provide emulated PLCs for both
        systems that were created using OpenPLC.</p>
