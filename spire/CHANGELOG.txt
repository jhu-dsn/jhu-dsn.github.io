Version 2.1 - February 29, 2024
   Added reconfiguration capability to Spire
	* Changes to SCADA Master to support reconfiguration
	* Uses Prime 4.0  ( Refer to CHANGELOG and README of Prime for details )
	* Uses Spines 5.6 ( Refer to CHANGELOG of Spines for details )
 	* Minor changes to benchmark and proxy programs to support reconfiguration 


Version 2.0 - January 27, 2023
   * Added two new components:
    1. Spire for the Substation:
        * Adds Real-Time Byzantine Resilience architecture and protocols to support power grid substations.
        * The architecture modules are emulated Relay, Relay Proxy, Trip Master and Breaker Proxy.
        * The substation protocol IEC61850 is supported by using open-source libiec61850 (https://libiec61850.com)
        * The two Real-Time Byzantine Resilience protocols are implemented in Trip Master (named, Peer Protocol) and Trip Master_v2 (named, Arbiter Protocol).
    2. Confidential Spire:
        * Enables data center replicas to participate in the replication protocol without executing application logic or accessing unencrypted state.
   
   
Version 1.3 - December 23, 2020
    * Added machine learning based Intruction Detection System ( refer its README in folder ids).
    * Updated to be compatible with modified APIs of  OpenSSL version 1.1.0 (spines and prime changes in their respective CHANGELOGs). 
    * Updated build system(s) and code to work with CentOS-8 (gcc and g++ 8.3.1). 
    * Updated OpenPLC to version that contains Opendnp3, and updated Makefile for dnp3_master accordingly.
    * Explored system tunining to optimize for minimal latency in single site configuration. Included such configuration example_conf to work in substation/LAN context. 
    * Uses Spines 5.5
    * Uses Prime 3.3

Version 1.2 - November 26, 2018
    * Updated to use Spines 5.4, which fixed a bug that could be triggered when
      link encryption is used in Spire

Version 1.1 - March 13, 2018
    * Added capability to automatically reset the system if the system
      assumptions are violated (specifically, if there are no longer enough
      correct replicas with the system state to re-integrate recovering
      replicas) based on a signal from Prime
    * Added new HMIs representing the 3-breaker, 5-breaker, and timing
      measurement systems demonstrated at the Hawaiian Electric Company in
      January/February 2018, as well as a new Energy Management System (EMS)
      HMI
    * Added additional example configurations and scripts to switch between
      configurations
        - Changed default configuration to use 6 replicas (simultaneously
          supporting one compromise and one proactive recovery) instead of 4
          (supporting one compromise or recovery at a time)
    * Some improvements to message validation
    * Updated to use Prime 3.1 (see Prime Changelog)
    * Updated to use Spines 5.3 (see Spines Changelog)
    * Included versions of pvbrowser, opendnp3, and OpenPLC tested to work
      with Spire as part of the Spire release package
    * Updated Makefile to compile the emulated PLCs for our example systems

Version 1.0 - May 17, 2017
    * Initial release.
