        <p>Spire consists of three components: Spire, Confidential Spire and
        Spire for the Substation. Below is detailed documentation of base
        Spire. </p> 
        <p>The documentation for building and running Confidential Spire is
        <a href="./README_Confidential_Spire.md">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The documentation for building and running Spire for the Substation is <a href="./README_Spire_Substation.md">here</a></p> 
        <hr>
        <p>A Spire deployment includes: SCADA Master replicas, Prime daemons, Spines
        daemons, PLC/RTU proxies, real or emulated PLCs and/or RTUs, and HMIs. These
        components can be distributed over multiple sites connected by a wide-area
        network, over multiple logical sites within a local-area network (with or
        without emulated wide-area latency) or as a single site in a local-area
        network.</p>

        <p>We typically deploy Spire with SCADA Master replicas distributed across several
        sites. For each SCADA master replica, we also deploy a Prime daemon that the
        SCADA master connects to. Each SCADA master is located on the same machine as
        its Prime daemon and connects to it via IPC.</p>

        <p>Communication in the system occurs over two Spines overlay networks: an
        external network and an internal network. The external network is used for
        communication between the SCADA Master replicas and the PLC/RTU proxies and the
        HMIs. The internal network is used for communication among the SCADA Master
        replicas (and their Prime daemons). External and internal Spines daemons can be
        deployed on the same machines but use different ports.</p>

        <p>We distinguish between two types of sites that can contain SCADA Master
        replicas: control centers and data centers. This is because power grid control
        centers with full capabilities for controlling PLCs and RTUs are generally
        expensive, and utility companies are unlikely to deploy more than two. To
        support the desired resilience with only two control centers, we allow
        additional sites to be added as data-center sites that do not control PLCs or
        RTUs.</p>

        <p>In each site that contains SCADA Master replicas (including both control
        centers and data centers), we typically deploy one Spines daemon that
        participates in the internal network to connect the replicas in that site to
        the other sites. In each control-center site, we additionally deploy a Spines
        daemon that participates in the external network to connect the replicas in
        that site to the proxies and HMIs.</p>

        <p>In the normal flow of the system, there are two main types of events: HMI
        commands and PLC/RTU updates. When an HMI command is initiated (e.g. a user
        clicks a button to make a change), the command is sent to the control-center
        SCADA Master replicas over the external Spines network. The SCADA Master
        replicas pass the command to their Prime daemons, which disseminate it to the
        data-center Prime daemons and execute a Byzantine-fault-tolerant agreement
        protocol to agree on the command. When the Prime daemons have agreed on the
        command, they pass it back to their SCADA Masters. The SCADA Masters then
        execute a threshold signing procedure on the command (so that the PLC/RTU proxy
        can verify that a sufficient number of replicas agreed on the command by
        verifying a single signature on a single message). The control-center SCADA
        Masters then send the threshold-signed command to the PLC/RTU proxies. The
        proxies verify that the command has a valid threshold signature and then pass
        it on to the PLC(s) or RTU(s).</p>

        <p>PLCs and RTUs are periodically polled by their proxies. When a proxy has new
        PLC/RTU data, it sends the data to the control-center SCADA Master
        replicas over the external Spines network to be agreed upon and sent to the
        HMI. The HMI verifies the threshold signature on the update and updates its
        display.</p>

        <p>There are several configuration files relevant to the Spire system:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> Main Spire configuration: common/def.h

        <li>PLC/RTU configuration: config/config.json
            <ul>
            <li> This file specifies the PLC/RTU Proxies and the PLCs and RTUs
            in the system. At the top, the total number of proxies in the SCADA
            system is specified. Each individual PLC/RTU proxy then has its own
            configuration settings, including a unique ID (starting at 0) and
            the protocols of the PLCs/RTUs this proxy will need to use (i.e.,
            Modbus and/or DNP3). Then, the specification of the individual PLCs
            and RTUs under the control of each Proxy is listed. These settings
            include which scenario (JHU, PNNL, EMS) that device belongs to and
            then Modbus-specific and DNP3-specific settings, such as the IP
            address and Port on which to connect with and the various field
            types and locations of the data stored in the PLC/RTU that is
            collected from equipment.</li>
            <li>NOTE: the Modbus and DNP3 configuration settings for the
            PLCs/RTUs must match the specification of the real (or emulated)
            PLC/RTU devices in order to properly connect with, monitor, and
            control those devices.</li>

            <li>Note that if your gcc/g++ >= 4.9 is not the default system gcc/g++, you
                will need to modify:
                <ol>
                <li>The Makefile in the dnp3 directory (set CXX and CXXLIB
                variables to point to your installation of g++ 4.9 or higher)
                <li>The build.sh script in opendnp/opendnp3_build (set C_LOC

                these locations)
                <li>The OpenPLC build.sh and core/core-builders/build_normal.sh
                scripts (set CXX_LOC variable to point to your g++ >= 4.9)
                </ol>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.automatak.com/opendnp3">Opendnp3</a>: Opendnp3

        Select "1) Blank" when prompted to build emulated PLCs for Linux.
        </ul>

        <p>* Note that the version of <a
        href="http://www.openplcproject.com/">OpenPLC</a> above with added DNP3
        support will eventually be merged with the main OpenPLC <a
        href="https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v2">branch</a>.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3> Spire Build Process </h3>

        <p>Note: Because the base Spire and Confidential Spire share certain configuration
        files and executables with compiled-in configuration parameters, we do not
        currently support running both versions at the same time. To switch from a
        Confidential Spire configuration to a base Spire configuration, first run `make
        clean` from the top-level Spire directory, and then follow the instructions
        below to build Spire.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Build Spines, pvbrowser, and OpenPLC: (from top-level Spire directory):
            <pre>make libs</pre></li>

        <li>Build Spire (from top-level Spire directory):
            <pre>make</pre></li>

                <h2> Generating Keys </h2>
                </div>

        </div> <!-- top-border-box --!>

        <div class="textbox">

        <p>All system entities use RSA keys to authenticate messages, so keys must be
        generated before the system can run.</p>

            <h3> Spines </h3>
            <p>To generate keys: <pre>cd spines/daemon; ./gen_keys</pre></p>

            <p>This creates 10 public-private key pairs in spines/daemon/keys (if you
              have more than 10 Spines daemons, you can modify the for loop in the
              script to create more keys)</p>

            <p>Each Spines daemon should have access to its own private key (i.e. the
              Spines daemon listed as host 1 in the spines.conf file should have the
              key private1.pem) and the public keys of all the Spines daemons.</p>

            <h3> Prime </h3>
            <p>To generate keys: <pre>cd prime/bin; ./gen_keys</pre></p>

            <p>This creates the following in prime/bin/keys:
                <ul>

                <li><code>NUM_SERVERS</code> server public-private key pairs
                (with public keys public_01.key, public_02.key, ... and private
                keys private_01.key, private_02.key, ...)</li>

                <li><code>NUM_CLIENTS</code> (default 150) client
                public-private key pairs (e.g. public_client_01.key,
                private_client_01.key)</li>

                <li>1 public key used by Prime daemons to authenticate
                threshold-signed messages used in the Prime protocol
                (pubkey_1.pem)</li>

                <li><code>NUM_SERVERS</code> threshold crypto shares used to
                generate threshold signatures in the Prime protocol
                (share0_1.pem, share1_1.pem, ...)</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p> Each Prime daemon should have access to its own private key and
            threshold crypto share (i.e. replica 1 should have keys
            private_01.key and share0_1.pem) and all public keys.</li><p>

            <p>Note that Prime's gen_keys program currently generates SCADA
            Master threshold crypto shares as well (see below).</p>

            <h3> Spire </h3>
            <p>To generate keys: <pre>cd scada_master; ./gen_keys</pre></p>

            <p> Since we consider a SCADA Master + its co-located Prime daemon
            one "replica", each SCADA Master uses the same public-private key
            pair as its Prime daemon (e.g. SCADA Master 1 uses the key pair
            prime/bin/keys/public_01.key, prime/bin/keys/private_01.key).</p>

            <p>PLC/RTU proxies and HMIs act as clients of Prime and use Prime
            client keys.

                <ul>
                <li> Proxies calculate their Prime client ID as <code>NUM_SM +
                1 + id</code>, where <code>id</code> is the ID of the proxy and
                ranges from 0 to <code>NUM_RTU - 1</code> (so in a system with
                4 replicas, proxy 0 should have the key pair
                public_client_05.key, private_client_05.key, proxy 1 should
                have public_client_06.key, private_client_06.key, etc.). <br>
                    * Note that benchmark clients (see "Running" section) use the same
                      keys as a proxy with the same ID would.</li>
                <li> HMIs calculate their Prime client ID as <code>NUM_SM + 1 +
                MAX_EMU_RTU + id</code>, where <code>id</code> is 1 for the
                jhu_hmi, 2 for the
                pnnl_hmi/heco_3breaker/heco_5breaker/heco_timing HMIs, and 3
                for the ems_hmi. <code>MAX_EMU_RTU</code> is 100 by default. In
                a system with 4 replicas, the jhu_hmi would have
                public_client_105.key and private_client_105.key, the
                pnnl_hmi/heco_hmi would have public_client_106.key and
                private_client_106.key, and the ems_hmi would have
                public_client_107.key and private_client_107.key.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>SCADA Master replicas execute a separate threshold-signing
            protocol outside of Prime to create threshold signatures that
            PLC/RTU proxies and HMIs can use to verify that the
            updates/commands they receive were agreed upon by enough replicas.
            For this, the SCADA Masters use their own set of threshold crypto
            shares.
                <ul>
                <li>These keys are generated by the scada_master gen_keys
                script. After scada_master/gen_keys has been run, these key
                shares will be located in scada_master/sm_keys. The
                scada_master/sm_keys directory includes:
                    <ul>
                    <li>1 public key used by PLC/RTU proxies and HMIs to verify
                    threshold signatures (pubkey_1.pem)</li>
                    <li><code>NUM_SERVERS</code> threshold crypto shares (e.g.
                    share0_1.pem, share1_1.pem, ...)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Each SCADA master should have access to its own public-private key pair,
              its own threshold crypto share, all SCADA master public keys, the
              threshold crypto public key, and all client public keys</p>

            <p>Each PLC/RTU proxy and HMI should have access to its own public-private
              key pair and all SCADA master and client public keys, and the threshold
              crypto public key.</p>

              one the proxies connect to)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> To run (internal Spines network): <pre>cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p SPINES_INT_PORT -c spines_int.conf</pre></p>
            <p> To run (external Spines network): <pre>cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p SPINES_EXT_PORT -c spines_ext.conf</pre></p>

            <p>These commands assume that the internal and external spines
            configuration files are located at spines/daemon/spines_int.conf and
            spines/daemon/spines_ext.conf, respectively.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Run all SCADA masters

            <p>To run (control center):
            <pre>cd scada_master; ./scada_master id spines_int_ip:SPINES_INT_PORT spines_ext_ip:SPINES_EXT_PORT</pre></p>

            <p>To run (data center):
            <pre>cd scada_master; ./scada_master id spines_int_ip:SPINES_INT_PORT</pre></p>

            <p>The spines_int_ip and spines_ext_ip should be the IP addresses of the
            internal and external Spines daemons this replica connects to. They should
            match addresses specified in <code>SPINES_INT_SITE_ADDRS</code> and
            <code>SPINES_EXT_SITE_ADDRS</code> in common/def.h.</p>

            <p>The <code>id</code> should be the ID of this replica, where IDs range from 1 to
            <code>NUM_SM</code>. The code assumes replicas are striped across sites; for example,
            for 12 replicas and 4 sites (of which 2 sites are control centers) we
            have:

            <ul>
                <li><code>NUM_SM</code> = 12, <code>NUM_SITES</code> = 4, <code>NUM_CC</code> = 2</li>
                <li>Site 1 (control center): Replicas 1, 5, 9</li>
                <li>Site 2 (control center): Replicas 2, 6, 10</li>
                <li>Site 3 (data center):    Replicas 3, 7, 11</li>
                <li>Site 4 (data center):    Replicas 4, 8, 12</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </p>

        <li>
            Run all Prime daemons
            <p>To run: <pre>cd prime/bin; ./prime -i id</pre></p>

            <p>The <code>id</code> of a Prime daemon must match the
            <code>id</code> of the SCADA Master that connects to it (and is
            running on the same machine as it).</p>

            <p>Prime uses its configuration files to find the location of the
            internal Spines daemon to connect to (see Prime documentation).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Run PLC/RTU proxies
            <p>To run: <pre>cd proxy; ./proxy id SPINES_RTU_ADDR:SPINES_EXT_PORT 1</pre></p>

            <p>The id should be the ID of this proxy, where IDs range from 0 to
            (NUM_RTU - 1). This ID is also used to look up information about the
            PLC/RTU in the config.json file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Run the HMIs
            <p>To run (jhu): <pre>cd jhu_hmi; ./jhu_hmi SPINES_HMI_ADDR:SPINES_EXT_PORT -port=pv_port_jhu</pre></p>
            <p>To run (pnnl): <pre>cd pnnl_hmi; ./pnnl_hmi SPINES_HMI_ADDR:SPINES_EXT_PORT -port=pv_port_pnnl</pre></p>
            <p>To run (ems): <pre>cd ems_hmi; ./ems_hmi SPINES_HMI_ADDR:SPINES_EXT_PORT -port=pv_port_ems</pre></p>

            <p><code>pv_port_*</code> is the port on which the HMI will accept
            pvbrowser connections to interface with the GUI that reflects the
            current power grid state and allows a human operator to enter
            commands.</p>

            <p>To connect GUI: Run pvbrowser application (located in main pvb
            installation folder). In the browser's address bar, give the IP
            address of the HMI and the <code>pv_port</code> (e.g.
            192.168.101.108:5050).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            (Optional) Run OpenPLC PLCs
            <pre>cd plcs/jhu0; sudo ./openplc -m 503 -d 20001</pre>
            <pre>...</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/jhu9; sudo ./openplc -m 512 -d 20010</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/pnnl_plc; sudo ./openplc -m 502 -d 20000</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems0; sudo ./openplc -m 513 -d 20011</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems1; sudo ./openplc -m 514 -d 20012</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems2; sudo ./openplc -m 515 -d 20013</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems_hydro; sudo ./openplc -m 516 -d 20014</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems_solar; sudo ./openplc -m 517 -d 20015</pre>
            <pre>cd plcs/ems_wind; sudo ./openplc -m 518 -d 20016</pre>

            <p>The <code>-m</code> option is the Modbus port, and the
            <code>-d</code> option is the DNP3 port. These should match what is
            specified in the config.json file for each PLC. See the <a
            href="http://www.openplcproject.com/plcopen-editor">OpenPLC
            documentation</a> for instructions on creating your own PLCs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            (Optional) Run Benchmark Clients

            <p>We also provide a benchmark client that can be used to test and measure
              the core of the system without running an HMI, PLC/RTU proxies, or
              PLCs/RTUs. The benchmark client submits updates to the system. The SCADA
              Masters agree on each of these updates just like they would for a normal
              PLC/RTU update and then send a response back to the benchmark client. The
              benchmark client calculates and prints the latency for processing each
              update (measured from the time it creates the update to the time it
              receives the corresponding response).</p>

            <p>To run: <pre>cd benchmark; ./benchmark id SPINES_RTU_ADDR:SPINES_EXT_PORT poll_frequency(usec) num_polls</pre></p>

            <p>The benchmark client will send an update every "poll_frequency"
            microseconds and will exit after completing "num_polls" updates. Benchmark
            client ids range from 0 to (NUM_RTU - 1).</p>
