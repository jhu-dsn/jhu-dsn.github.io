<LI><H2>Does this cause any problems?
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>What it means is that routers that are not in the AS that originated the announcement have very limited knowledge of exactly where the destination is.
<LI>Because of this limited knowledge, networks do what is known as closest exit routing.
<UL>
<LI>This operates under the assumption that the destination network has more specific knowledge of the destination than I do, so I will get said traffic out of my network as quickly as possible.</UL></UL></UL></P>
