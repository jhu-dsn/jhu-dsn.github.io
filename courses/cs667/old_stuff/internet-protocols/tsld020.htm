 <H1>Why have different routing protocols?</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>OSPF sounds like it is so automatic and fast, why not use it everywhere?
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Well, there are a couple of problems.
<UL>
<LI>First, once a route is in the OSPF network, it cannot be removed.  This creates problems with certain routing policies.
<LI>Second, OSPF gives you very little control over what routes you announce.  Once a route is in the OSPF network, it must go to every router in said network.
<LI>This is why there are simpler protocols like BGP4.</UL></UL></UL></P>
