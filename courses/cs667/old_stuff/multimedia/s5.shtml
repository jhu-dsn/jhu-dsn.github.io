<P>
Different protocols and compression algorithms are used for different kinds of video.
<P>
The tradeoffs between quality and speed and size change depending on the goal.  For example, MPEG-1 even though it can produce a 10Mbs stream would not provide nearly the same quality 10Mbs stream as a MPEG-2 encoding would at the same bitrate.
