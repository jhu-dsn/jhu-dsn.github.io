  <tr><td></td><td>People, businesses, and managers love the
  "Internet".  It is not the Internet as a whole that they like, but
  TCP/IP traffic on ports 80 and 25 (HTTP and SMTP (typical email),
  respectively) that drive commerce.  To businesses that <i>is</i> the
  Internet.  Now we have immense amounts of HTTP traffic clogging the
  "pipes" of the current Internet plumbing system.  Much focus, now,
  is going into reducing the amount of unnecessary traffic.  Most
  approaches to this problem attempt some form of replicated
  information at key interconnects in the topology of the network.
  <p>These solutions will help make things more effecient even if in a
  few years, bandwidth will increase by a factor of 10 or 100.  People
  should never need a reason to implement things in the most effecient
  manner, becuase the demand placed on the system will almost always
  match the physical resources available.</td>

  <tr bgcolor=#bbbbbb><td></td><td><dd><B>Future
  Directions</B></td></tr> <tr><td></td><td>As demand for "neat"
  things increases on the Internet, solutions to provide these things
  seemlessly to the user will evolve.  Many things start out as "neat"
  and turn into a powerful and useful tools for everyday work.  No
  matter how large the Internet gets and no matter how "big the pipes
  get", demand will push the system to the limit.  Servers will become
  faster to serve even more information and clients will become faster
  and greedier, wanting to pull more information.  <p>The speed of the
  personal computer will evolve as it has since its birth and the need
  for distributed computing will be both inside and outside of the
  box.</td></tr>
