<h4>Bringing Bluetooth "Into the Cloud"</h4>
Ryan McLelland<br><br><br>

<b>Overview</b><br><br>

&nbsp;As more and more everyday electronics become Bluetooth enabled, the utility of the technology is only going<br>
to increase. At the moment, Bluetooth radios are limited in range to around 100 meters, and this range is greatly <br>
decreased when indoors. The idea behind the Bluefi project was to enable Bluetooth devices to discover and interact<br>
with each other when they are outside of the range of their Bluetooth radio. This would be made possible through the<br>
creation of 'Bluetooth Access Points', which would be connected to the Internet through either Wifi or an ethernet <br>
connection, and which would also have a Bluetooth adapter. A local Bluetooth device would connect to an access point,<br>
which would tunnel the Bluetooth communications over the Internet to another access point, which would then forward <br>
it to the remote Bluetooth device. Implementing this technology would expand the uses of current Bluetooth protocols,<br>
and also enable new protocols to be implemented for Bluetooth devices, such as multicast.
