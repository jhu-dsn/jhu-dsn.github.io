<h2>Resilient Dissemination through Flooding</h2> 
Kieran Magee<br><br><br> 
 
<h4>Overview</h4><br><br> 
 
Communication using the regular Internet is cost effective, but can
suffer from interruptions due to congestion or reroutes. An overlay
approach (where a relatively small number of nodes on top of an
underlying network work together) allows for more stateful protocols.
This project investigated flooding messages on the overlay to
achieve a more resilient messaging system. In this way, since
messages are flooded, if there is even one path from source
to destination, the messages will arrive at the destination.

The outcome of this project was a prototype system which flooded
messages in an emulated environment.
