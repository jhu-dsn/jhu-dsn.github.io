<h2>Spiny Android<h2> 
<h4>A mesh network on the Android platform.</h4> 
Tom Tantillo, Abhishek Prakash, and Daniel Obenshain<br><br><br> 
 
<b>Overview</b><br><br> 
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android phones are a smartphone platform that has become very popular.
They have a reputation for being easy to use for development purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine a situation where you have a phone with no connectivity, but your friend
next to you has a phone that does have connectivity. It would be nice to be able to share that connectivity
between the two of you. In order to enable this, we ported Spines onto the Android platform. That way, we
could form a mesh network of android phones and send between them. Then, we used raw sockets to stop packets
from leaving the phone in the normal way
and instead routed them on our mesh network.</p>
