      <h1><b>Project Description</b></h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Our project team is working to help prepare the <a href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/spire">Spire System</a>, an intrusion tolerant SCADA system, to withstand sophisticated red team attacks on the power grid infrastructure. We will work to develop attack vectors and mitigating mechanisms toward a more resilient grid</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey w3-large">Our initial approach is to benchmark the Prime and Spines components that are integrated into the Spire System for latency and throughput. With this we can get a healthy baseline, to then be able to judge the effectiveness of an attack. </p>

      <h1><b>Our Attacks</b></h1>
      <h2 class="w3-padding-32">Leader Change Attack</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey w3-large"> We conducted our attacks from the inside, with the assumption that we
        had access to one compromised replica. With this compromised replica we
        target the current leader with excessive ping messages to slow that leader’s 
        round trip time. The delayed round trip time then forces a leader change as the 
        leader is determined to be too slow by the other replicas. This process of changing 
        leaders when too slow is mandated by the Suspect Leader Protocol of the Prime system. 
        Ping messages while effective in slowing down the leader as they require it to reply,
        slow the compromised replica down because it must process the pong messages received
        from the leader. This causes the new leader message, which updates the current leader
        for a replica, to be pushed behind thousands of pongs. So to keep up with the current
        view of the leader the compromised replica then filters out all messages except pings
        and leader changes. This is successful at causing the leader to change continuously 
        while the compromised replica is running, raising the overall latency of the system
        to an average of around 31 ms. Combined with a proactive recovery of a replica this
        attack can no longer force a leader change but can raise the acceptable latency for
        a leader. This means that while the compromised replica targets the leader and is
        ineffective at forcing a change it can increase the average round trip time of a
        transaction to be around 40 ms with some percentage of messages having an rtt
        above 100 ms. We have also been attempting to divide resources of the
        compromised replica between the current and next leader to reduce
        the time between the leader changing and the compromised replica’s
        knowledge that the leader has changed. From the inside with 1
        compromised replica, we are able to consistently force a leader
        change which raises the average round trip time of a transaction.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-padding-32">Memory Attack</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey w3-large"> Our attack is based on a Prime's preorder protocol
        which allows for a compromised replica to consume an arbitrary amount of
        memory on the correct replicas. As part of the preoder protocol, when a 
        replica recieves an update from a client, they inform all the other 
        replicas of that update and bind it to a unique sequence number. All other
        replicas store those updates until they are globally ordered and executed.
        The flaw in protocol is that correct replicas do not place any bound on the
        number of updates they will store from any other replica. Generally, this is
        not an issue because updates are ordered and executed in a timely fashion
        which allows valid replicas to reclaim their memory by flushing old updates.
        However, a compromised replica can exploit the protocol in the following way.
        In order to maintain correctness, client updates must be executed in order.
        Therefore, if a faulty replica withholds an early sequence number, correct
        replicas must store all following updates because they will be unable to 
        execute them before receiving the earlier (withheld) update. By continuing
        to send updates, the faulty server forces the valid replicas to store an 
        arbitrary amount of data which causes them to becomes unresponsive when 
        they run out of RAM. Our current implementation of the attack consumes 
        0.02GB of memory per second.
