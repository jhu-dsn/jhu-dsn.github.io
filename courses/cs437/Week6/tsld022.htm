1. Prove that the protocol is correct.
</UL><UL>
i.e. that it satisfies the agreement, validity and 
</UL><UL>
termination (with probability 1) requirements.
</UL><UL>
Termination means - for reaching a decision.
</UL><UL>
 Assume at most f Byzantine failures.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
The model is: n processes connected by a full graph,
</UL><UL>
communication is reliable FIFO,  although messages from 
</UL><UL>
different processes can arrive at different order to 
</UL><UL>
different processes and faulty processes may crash or lie 
</UL><UL>
(possibly tell different things to different processes, or
</UL><UL>
not tell anything to some or all of them).
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
2. (only 437) Modify the algorithm so that 
</UL><UL>
eventually, all non faulty processes halt.</UL></P>
