<dt><em>Project description</em></a> (November 27, 2000)
<dd>A copy of the <a href="project.txt">project description</a> is available.
</dd>
<dt><em>Theory Homework 2 slides</em></a> (October 31, 2000)
<dd>Some people had difficulty getting access to the theory 2 assignment because the CS webserver
has had some problems. Here is the homework slide <a href="sld022.htm">Slide 22</a>.
</dd>
<dt><em>Deadline for Exercise 2</em></a> (October 31, 2000)
<dd>To make sure everyone is aware. The deadline for ex2 is DURING class wednesday. 
I will collect the online submissions at 5pm wednesday. Because the multicast assignment
is causing significant disruption of the department network we will not extend the deadline.
</p>
We also request that you DO NOT run your multicast programs after the deadline. The only people
who should run them are myself and the TA's when we are evaluating them.</p>

<dt><em>Design comments on Exercise 2</em></a> (October 23, 2000)
<dd>General comments on exercise 2 design
<ol>
<li>The sender needs to also receive all packets.
<li>There is no graph of the nodes, no point-to-point links, no trees for this assignment.
The network should be considered a local area network where one multicast packet can reach every mcast.
<li>You need to discuss termination, and what happens if the last packet is lost a lot.
<li>Your protocol should not use the information of how many packets will be sent to start
your protocol. You should only tell the receivers that they have all the packets at the very end. Maybe
by sending some type of "end" packet.
<li>You can piggyback acks/nacks/messages with other messages.
<li>If you use a sliding window, then make sure it 'slides' and doesn't 'jump'. For every packet that
is acknowledged completely you should move your window base by one. You should not wait until the entire
window is acknowedged before going onto new packets in the next window.
<li>You must write packets to the file as soon as you receive them in order. You should not wait
until the end of the program run before writing the entire packet set to disk.
<li>Use multicast addresses (226.0.1.1) NOT broadcast (255.255.255.0).
<li>You are not transfering files. You are sending packets.
<li>Each "mcast" program writes to only ONE file. NOT one file per sender.
<li>For performance reasons (and to make your lives debugging easier) minimize the number of threads used.
</ol>
</dd>
<dt><em>First exercise handed out</em></a> (September 25, 2000)
<dd>
The first programming exercise was handed out in section today. See below in the Exercises section for details.
</dd>
<dt><em>Reference material added to website</em></a> (September 20, 2000)
<dd>
New reference material is now <a href="ref.html">available</a>. This includes useful books, programming
guides, and websites about sockets.
</dd>
<dt><em>Class begins!</em></a> (September 11, 2000)
<dd>
Please make sure to you have a user account on the CS Department Undergrad machines.
All of these machines are located in NEB 225 (accross from the department office). 
You will <em>NEED</em> this account to turn in your assignments, get course information, 
and test your programs. You must have an account on the SUN machines (hops, barley, ugrad1..n)
If you want to use the NT machines you can also get an account on them. <em>HOWEVER</em>, ALL
testing and evaluation of your assignments will be done on the SUN machines so your programs 
must work correctly on the sun machines.

<p>
The course teaches how to design and implement efficient tools,
protocols and systems in a distributed environment.
The course tries to give some hands-on experience as well as some
theoretical background.
The programming assignments and the project in the course can be 
done in either C/C++ or Java. These assignments will use a cluster 
of workstations as well as several software research tools.
</p>
For more information about the course please contact either of the instructors. 
Our email and phone numbers can be found on our web pages.</p>
