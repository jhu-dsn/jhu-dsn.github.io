<dt><em>Testing Configuration for Programming Assignment</em></a> (November 5, 1999)
<dd>
The configuration to be used for the 12000 packet tests is given below. This file should be exactly
used for anyone doing the assignment in C. If you use Java, you should use the same graph configuration, <em>BUT</em>
you should change the machines to be ANY 6 WinNT machines in the CS TEACHING LAB. 
They should be all equivelent in strength. I have heard that there are problems with the 
WinNT machines in the regular undergrad lab so you probably don't want to use them. 
The file can also be downloaded as <a href="test.config">test.config</a>.

<dt><em>Correction to Programming Assignment</em></a> (October 27, 1999)
<dd>
A correction to the file format of the configuration file for the programming assignment. As noted in class
there is currently no way to know which machine number corresponds to which real-world machine (i.e. IP address).
The new config file will solve this by giving the wancast process the ip addresses of each machine. The new format
is as follows:
<br><pre>
Graph <num of machines>
(1,2)
(1,3)
(3,4)
Machines
1 128.220.13.30
2 128.220.13.87
3 128.220.223.100
4 128.220.223.50
</pre>
As before blank lines and lines starting with a '#' character should be ignored.<p>
The ip addresses I gave in the above file are MADE UP and SHOULD NOT be used in your actual tests. Just create
your own config file with the ip addresses of the machines you would like to use.

<dt><em>New Theory and Programming Assignment handed out</em></a> (October 20, 1999)
<dd>
A new Thoery assignment was given in class today, it can be found in the Week 6 slides and is due November 10.
Also, the second programming assignment was handed out. In it you have to build a reliable multicast application
that uses point-to-point reliable channels and can work over arbitrary tree networks. A design document is due
next Wednesday October 27 and the full project is due November 8.
<p>
A new version of the sendto_dbg.c function is available which allows you to set the percentage of loss. A Java
version is also available. Both can be found in the ~cs437/exercises/ex1 directory on the undergrad machines.

<p> Taught by 
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yairamir/">Yair Amir</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jonathan/">Jonathan Stanton</a>.
</p>
<p>
The course teaches how to design and implement efficient tools,
protocols and systems in a distributed environment.
The course tries to give some hands-on experience as well as some
theoretical background.
The programming assignments and the project in the course can be 
done in either C/C++ or Java. These assignments will use a cluster 
of workstations as well as several software research tools.

<em>Prerequisites:</em> 
<ul>
<li>Computer Systems Fundamentals( 600.333 ) 
<li>Data Structures ( 600.226 )

Due Monday December 13, 1999 or January xxxx, 2000.<br>
The three options are:
<ol>
<li>Build a replicated, distributed Mail Server that can provide mail messages and keep track of the state of messages even when partitions and crashes occur. The assignment is available at
<a href="project1.txt">this web site</a> and in the ~cs437 directory on the undergrad machines.
<li>Explore high-performance computing on a cluster of workstations using the MOSIX distributed operating system. This will involve writing a program that computes a matrix multiplication in a parallel way and a second program that plays the game of life and utilizes the most possible resources out of a cluster of machines. Talk to Yair for more information.
<li>Any other idea you come up with that fits in with the course. Come talk to us, we are always interested in new ideas.
