<dt><em>Exercise 3 deadline extended</em> (November 17, 2001)
<dd>
<p>Because of the unavailability of the ugrad network on saturday Nov. 17th. I 
am extending the deadline for ex3 to Tuesday, November 20th at NOON. Because
we do not have class. You should turn in all the written materials to my 
mailbox in the main CS department office. </p>
<p>The deadline of NOON is strict as I will pick them up exactly at 
that time and give them to the graders, so late assignemnts will not be able
to be graded until after Thanksgiving and thus will be quite late.</p>

The course teaches how to design and implement efficient tools,
protocols and systems in a distributed environment.
The course tries to give some hands-on experience as well as some
theoretical background.
The programming assignments and the project in the course can be 
done in either C/C++ or Java. These assignments will use a cluster 
of workstations as well as several software research tools.
</p>
For more information about the course please contact the instructor. 
Their email and phone number can be found on this web page.</p>

<h5>Academic Integrity</h5>
<p>Academic Honesty and Ethical behavior are required in this course, as it is in all 
courses at Johns Hopkins University. This course will strictly enforce the Computer Science 
Department Academic Integrity policy which can be found by following the link above. </p>
<p>The essence of the policy is that you must work on your own on all assignments, unless told
otherwise in writing. This includes discussing how to work on it and sharing code or solutions. 
You are also prohibited from altering or falsifying the output of programs. We run all code submissions
ourselves and grade based on how they work when we run them. If it appears that you have falsified the
reported results it will be treated as severely as if you had cheated or plagerized someone elses work.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to talk with the professor about any questions you have about what is permitted
on any particular assignment.</p>
