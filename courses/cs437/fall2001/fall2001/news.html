<dt><em>Exercise 3 deadline extended</em> (November 17, 2001)
<dd>
<p>Because of the unavailability of the ugrad network on saturday Nov. 17th. I 
am extending the deadline for ex3 to Tuesday, November 20th at NOON. Because
we do not have class. You should turn in all the written materials to my 
mailbox in the main CS department office. </p>
<p>The deadline of NOON is strict as I will pick them up exactly at 
that time and give them to the graders, so late assignemnts will not be able
to be graded until after Thanksgiving and thus will be quite late.</p>

Please make sure to you have a user account on the CS Department Undergrad machines.
All of these machines are located in NEB 225 (accross from the department office). 
You will <em>NEED</em> this account to turn in your assignments, get course information, 
and test your programs. You must have an account on the SUN machines (hops, barley, ugrad1..n)
If you want to use the NT machines you can also get an account on them. <em>HOWEVER</em>, ALL
testing and evaluation of your assignments will be done on the SUN machines so your programs 
must work correctly on the sun machines.
