<LI>First, list what properties are needed to be proven.
</UL><UL>
<LI>Remember: no process decides before the f+1 round.
</UL><UL>
<LI>The values of the local vectors are identical at all the processes that make it to the f+1 round ( why?) . 
</UL><UL>
-What is the best way to change the algorithm if a message can sometimes be delayed and arrive in the next round rather than only in the round it was sent?</UL></P>
