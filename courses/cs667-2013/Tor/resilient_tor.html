        <h1>Increased Resiliency for Tor</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In current Tor implementation, it require each directory server as well as each client to know each of the relay nodes in the Tor 
        network. Each relay node needs to periodically sign and send its public key, bandwidth, port, and other informations to the Tor 
        directory server. Meanwhile, the Tor directory servers need to periodically generate a consensus view of the current relay nodes, by 
        sign and send individual view of the Tor network to others. After all the directory servers reach consensus, they will make the view 
        of current Tor network available to each Tor relay, and Tor client. This approach makes Tor  vulnerable to be censored. If the ISP 
        block the access the Tor directory servers, then tor client cannot get a view of the current Tor network and will not be able to work 
        properly.</p>

        <p>
        In order to make Tor more resilient to censorship, Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) can be used to replace the Tor 
        directory server.  Instead of asking the directory server for the information of each relay nodes in current Tor network, Tor client 
        can query the DNSSEC for those information. As mentioned previously, in current Tor implementation, each client need to download a 
        consus view of the current Tor nodes, which include: node name, node fingerprint, IP address, port, time of appearing,  bandwidth, 
        version of Tor running. Those information can be put on one or several DNSSEC servers. Meanwhile, Tor will have hundreds of regular 
        changed domain names that is based on a hash function, and each domain name only responsible for a subset of the Tor nodes. The query 
        result of each domain name is encrypted with  correspondent domain name key which is also changed regularly. This will make sure as 
        long as one domain name is not blocked, then Tor is still available.
