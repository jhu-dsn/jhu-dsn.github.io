<h1> Big Data and Consistency </h1>

<p> Amy Babay </p>

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

<p> The rise of "Big Data" and the increasing need to store terabytes or
petabytes of data across many machines and multiple data centers has lead to
the proliferation of large-scale data storage systems. This project
investigated the guarantees provided by these systems, looking specifically at
<a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> as an example of a popular
system of this type,  and examined approaches for achieving full consistency in
such systems.</p>

<p> I considered four Big Data use-patterns: (1) write once/read many, (2)
simple key-value updates, (3) compound key-value updates, and (4) database
transactions. Each use-pattern places distinct requirements on the data storage
system. In order to use Big Data effectively, it is necessary to select or
design a system that provides the appropriate guarantees for the specific use
case. In this project, I examined existing solutions for the first two uses
cases and evaluated the applicability of consistent replication techniques to
use cases three and four. While replication engines are a possible approach to
solving the problem of compound updates, more general agreement protocols are
necessary to implement distributed transactions. </p>
