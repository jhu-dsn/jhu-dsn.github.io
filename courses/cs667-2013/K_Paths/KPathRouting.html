<p>I was interested in ways to create additional resiliency to network faults and partitions in overlay networks. During this semester, I explored how routing packets along multiple paths can help achieve this.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I built a model of an overlay network that does multipath routing. It does source-based routing and uses a Min-Cost/Max-Flow algorithm to calculate an optimal k-path route. More details on the project can be found in my presentation <a href="multipathmodel.pptx">here</a> (in pdf form <a href="multipathmodel.pdf">here</a>). The source code for this model, the routing algorithm, and the test clients can be found <a href="bellis_multipathmodel.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
