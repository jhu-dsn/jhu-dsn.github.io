The ugrad machines
==================

In the CS220 course, we will be using the 24 ugrad machines maintained by the
Computer Science Department. The names of these machines are ugrad1.cs.jhu.edu,
ugrad2.cs.jhu.edu, ugrad3.cs.jhu.edu, ... , ugrad24.cs.jhu.edu. You can use any
of these 24 machines -- if you create a file on a particular ugrad machine, you
will be able to view and edit it on any of the other machines as well.

These computers are physically located in Malone Hall 122 and Malone Hall G61.
Your JCard should give you access to these labs (non-CS students with course
accounts may not have access immediately, but access can be arranged).


Accessing the ugrad machines remotely
=====================================

During class, we will work on the ugrad machines remotely from the Maryland 310
classroom, and you can do this to work on your projects at home on your laptop
too.

To connect to the ugrad machines remotely, we will use ssh.

On Windows:
-----------
You will need to install PuTTY, which is available here:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

Once you have PuTTY installed, the steps to login are:
1. Start PuTTY

2. The PuTTY Configuration window should appear. Enter the name of the ugrad
   machine you want to connect to (for example, ugrad10.cs.jhu.edu) in the
   "Host Name (or IP address)" box. The "Port" box should be 22, and the
   "Connection type" should be SSH.

3. Click the "Open" button.

4. The first time you connect to a particular ugrad machine, a box will pop up
   saying that PuTTY does not recognize the server's host key. Most of the time
   it's fine to click "yes" here, but if you want to be completely safe, you
   can first verify that the key fingerprint showing in the pop-up box matches
   the one in the "SSH Fingerprint Table for Ugrad Net machines" here:
   https://support.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/SSH_Key_Fingerprints_for_Grad_and_Ugrad_Net_Linux_Computers

5. A PuTTY window will appear with the prompt "login as:". Type your user name
   and hit enter (if you got your account through the cs220 course, your user
   name starts with "ipa" and ends with some number from 1-40).

6. You'll then be prompted for your password. Type it in and hit enter.

7. You should now be logged into your account.

On Mac:
-------
1. Open up a terminal window
    - Terminal.app can be found in the Utilities folder inside the Applications
      folder.

2. In the terminal window, type: 
        ssh your_user_name@ugrad#.cs.jhu.edu
   with "your_user_name" replaced by your user name and "#" replaced by a number
   between 1 and 24.
   
   For example, if your user name is ipa40, and you want to log into ugrad10,
   you would type:
        ssh ipa40@ugrad10.cs.jhu.edu

3. You will be prompted for your password. Type it in and hit enter.

4. You should now be logged into your account.


Accessing the course code
=========================

All the code we go over in class is kept in the amir220 account on the ugrad
machines.

To get to the home directory of the amir220 account type:
    cd ~amir220

To see everything in that directory type:
    ls

To get to the code in the Week1 directory type:
    cd Week1

To view a particular file, type:
    less filename (for example, less hello_world.c)

    - After using "less" to view a file, you can use the arrow keys to move up
      and down in the file (if it doesn't all fit on the screen at once) and
      press the "q" key to quit looking at the file.
