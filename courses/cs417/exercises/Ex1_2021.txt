        Exercise 1
        ==========

Construct a reliable point-to-point basic file transfer tool using UDP/IP.

1. The assignment:

Using the unreliable UDP/IP protocol, you should write a tool that reliably copies
a file to another machine.

The tool consists of two programs: 
	ncp - the sender process.
	rcv - the receiver process.

In order to perform a file transfer operation, a receiver process (rcv) should be 
run on the target machine.  

A sender process (ncp) should be run on the source machine using 
the following interface:

ncp <loss_rate_percent> <source_file_name> <dest_file_name>@<comp_name>
where <comp_name> is the name of the computer where the server runs
(ugrad1, ugrad2, etc.)

A receiver process (rcv) should handle an UNLIMITED number of file-transfer 
operations, but it is allowed to handle one operation at a time (sequence them). 
If a sender comes along while the receiver is busy, the sender should be blocked 
until the receiver completes the current transfer. The sender should know about 
this and report this.
The receiver process has the following interface:
rcv <loss_rate_percent>
where loss rate is the percentage loss of sent packets. 
e.g., rcv 10 will drop 10 percent before sending.

A sender process (npc) handles one operation and then terminates. 
You can assume that the source file name represents a specific single file.

To check the software, each process (both rcv and npc) should be calling a coat 
routine named sendto_dbg instead of the sendto system call. The coat routine 
will allow control of an emulated network loss percentage for each sent packet.

THIS SHOULD BE DONE FOR EVERY SEND OPERATION IN THE CODE (both for the 
sender and the receiver).

The coat routine sendto_dbg has a similar interface to sendto (see man 2 sendto). 
The sendto_dbg routine will randomly decide to discard packets in order to create 
additional network message omissions based on the loss rate. 
An initialization routine, sendto_dbg_init, should be called once, in the beginning 
of each scenario, to set the loss rate for that scenario. 
The source for the sendto_dbg and sendto_dbg_init routines is available in 
the course home directory ~cs417/exercises/ex1/

Both the sender (ncp) and the receiver (rcv) programs should report two statistics 
every 100Mbytes of data sent/received IN ORDER (all the data from the beginning of 
the file to that point was received with no gaps):
    1) The total amount of data (in Mbytes) successfully transferred by that time.
    2) The average transfer rate of the last 100Mbytes sent/received (in Mbits/sec).

At the end of the transfer, both sender and receiver programs should report the size 
of the file transferred, the amount of time required for the transfer, and the 
average rate at which the communication occurred (in Mbits/sec).

2. Performance:

Using the reliable TCP/IP protocol, implement the corresponding t_ncp and t_rcv. 
These should report the amount of data transferred and the rate, the same way 
as ncp and rcv programs. The t_rcv is not required to handle multiple senders. 
It can handle a single sender and then exit.

Compare the performance of (ncp rcv) to (t_ncp t_rcv) by measuring the time it takes 
to copy a 1 Gbytes file from one computer to another computer on the ugrad network.

You should run these tests for the ncp/rcv 5 times for each of the following 
loss rates (0% 1% 5% 10% 15% 25%), averaging the results for each case. Please graph the 
results with the X-axis being the loss rate and the Y-axis being the time the copy took. 

Thus, you should turn in results comparing eight experiments:
1. t_ncp/t_rcv
2. ncp/rcv with zero loss rate
3. ncp/rcv with %1 loss rate
4. ncp/rcv with %5 loss rate
5. ncp/rcv with %10 loss rate
6. ncp/rcv with %15 loss rate
7. ncp/rcv with %25 loss rate
8. ncp/rcv with zero loss rate, run AT THE SAME TIME with t_ncp/t_rcv
  (this will evaluate your protocol when COMPETING with TCP)

Please have a table with the results of the experiments and a graph as described above.

3. Submission:

Two separate submissions are required.

1) A paper submission of your draft design. Due Thursday September 9 at the beginning 
of class. Submission documents should be computer printed (not hand-written !)

An initial design document should be a well-written, complete design of your ncp 
and rcv programs and the protocols used to make it reliable. This includes the main 
ideas behind your protocol, the internal data structure in each program, the type and 
structure of the messages used, and the protocol (algorithm) description. 
It should be about 2 pages long with diagrams as needed. 

A final design document is required with your final submission. 
Design makes up 20% of the exercise grade. 

2) An electronic submission of all the documents/code described above.
Due Friday September 17 at 11:00pm. You should make a tar file named exactly as 
your login account with all your documents and code (DO NOT include the 1 GBytes file 
transferred, core file, object files, or executables) and email the tar file as 
an attachment to cs417@cs.jhu.edu. The subject of the email should be 
"Exercise 1 submission <account name>", and in the body of the email include 
the names of the two students involved.

The complete submission should include your final design (in txt or pdf formats). 
It should also include a discussion of the performance results you achieved and 
discuss the comparison of how the protocol worked under different percentages of loss.

The programs should be complete, sound, and well documented. 

A makefile that compiles and builds your complete program with clearly documented 
options (if needed) is required.

You should work on it in groups of exactly 2 students. Contact us if you cannot find 
a partner and we will assign a partner for you.

Example for creating the tar file:

If your login account on ugrad machines is <yourname>, then create a directory 
named <yourname> and copy all your source code, makefile, documentation and design in 
that directory. DO NOT copy the 1 GBytes file you used for testing your programs 
or any intermediate other files.  

Outside of the <yourname> directory run the following command:

tar -cf <yourname>.tar <yourname>

Failure to comply with submission instructions may result in a lower grade.
Issues such as correctness, design, documentation, and, of course, 
efficiency will be considered.

Final Submission date is Friday, September 17, 2021, 11:00pm.


Notes and suggestions:
----------------------

1. Please contact us to get your assigned port - each group should use their own
   port so that your protocol will not clash with other people's protocols.
2. Packet size should not exceed 1400 Bytes.
3. Experiment with different window sizes.
4. Make sure the program works with any file, not only ascii files.
5. Check that the received file is identical to the original file (diff).
6. Make sure files are local to the computers you are using (not via NFS) - 
   for example, you could use the /tmp directory for that but then make sure
   you erase all these files from each ugrad computer you use every time you log off.
