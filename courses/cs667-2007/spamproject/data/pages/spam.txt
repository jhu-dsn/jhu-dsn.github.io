===== Problem =====

The influx of spam has caused email to become a less effective tool for communication, and the problem is getting worse.  Despite the application of today’s best filters spam continues to find its way into our inboxes in ever increasing numbers.

The nature of the email system makes it susceptible to spam.  Email allows the sender to falsify many of the fields contained within the message including the sender address and email server history.  This leaves no way to determine accountability and hinders the ability to filter spam and enforce spamming laws.  Email also carries no cost.  Unlike sending a letter through the postal system, email is free and carries little performance cost.   This means that spammers can send large volumes of spam every day.  Even if filters operate with a high rate of accuracy they will still allow a large number of spam messages into the user’s inbox relative to the number of legitimate messages.

Spammers are also constantly working to bypass anti-spam techniques, and the amount of spam being sent is constantly increasing.  It is estimated that spam costs corporations about $2000 per employee per year in lost productivity, and the same corporations have reported a 6% reduction in spam filter effectiveness over the course of 10 months.  The total cost of spam in 2003 was estimated at $20 billion dollars. 

As we approached the issue of spam it became clear that a major difficulty is that most metrics we tried for comparing spam and non-spam were inconclusive.  Most of them might show a probabilistic chance of a message being one or the other, but often the difference between the two was weak and difficult to apply to individual messages.  However, a few methods were very effective at clearly distinguishing the two, and they became the methods that we adopted.

===== Goals =====

The goals of this project are as follows:

  - Decrease the number of uncaught spam messages by 50%.
  - Impose a cost on the sender for delivering a spam message.

===== Decreasing Uncaught Spam =====

We wish to decrease the number of uncaught spam messages in our own network by 50%.  We are already employing a major spam filter known as Spam Assassin.  In order to improve the effectiveness of spam filtering, we attempt to attempt to identify new tests that can accurately label a message as either spam or as a non-spam.  We will utilize any information available to the email server including the previous history of received email.

As stated previously email lacks accountability which makes the prevention of spam a tougher problem.  However one piece of information we do know to be correct is the IP address of the computer delivering the message directly to our server.  This is a requirement of the TCP/IP communication system on which Email operates.  Thus we will utilize this piece of information in many of our tests.

=== Environment ===

The Distributed Systems and Networks Lab maitains its own email server hosting a number of email accounts.  For each account a user specific instance of Spam Assassin attempts to filter out spam using a variety of techniques such as DNS blacklists and Bayesian Content Filtering.  The filter adds a unique tag to the subject of each message it has identified as spam.  We introduce our own filters to the exim server which add additional tags to the subject of the email, one for each test which identifies the message as spam.  For a selection of the accounts the email is hand filtered into non-spam, marked spam, and unmarked spam categories.  We then analyze the email to determine how many of the messages not marked by Spam Assassin were caught by one of our filters.  Of course we also investigate how many legitimate messages were flagged as spam.

The email flow is defined in steps as follows:

  - Sender connects and provides From and To Email Addresses.
  - Message is rejected if problems exist with addresses (i.e., sender cannot be verified or the recipient doesn't exist on the server).
  - Message is passed to exim_local_scan script for testing.
  - Heuristics are run and subject is augmented with flags.
  - Message is passed to user specific Spam Assassin.
  - Message is delivered to user inbox.

=== Initial Questions ===

In determining which heuristics to deploy, we sought the answers to several questions regarding the properties of our email.  Those [[initial_questions|questions and answers]] can be viewed here.

=== Tests ===
Ultimately we implemented the following heuristics:
  - **Hostname** 
    * Any email which is not generated locally is marked if there is no hostname associated with the connecting IP address.  This rule is based on the fact that a legitimate server will always have a host name.<code>
- If there is no host name associated:
  - Flag the message with NO_HOSTNAME</code>
  - **IP Repeat**
    * Any server which connects and sends a spam (a decision based on the user-based SpamAssassin score, with a threshold of 5) is added to a local blacklist.  The blacklist is then utilized to mark all the proceeding messages coming from that server as spam.  Potentially, this rule can easily generate false positives as servers can send both spam and non-spam messages (for example, botnets which send spam through the ISP mail server).  The following steps are performed:<code>
- Identify the closest IP address outside of Hopkins address space using SMTP path included in the message header.
  Closest IP address is defined more clearly as the first IP address which doesn't belong to Hopkins, in the reverse order of the SMTP path. 
- Is the IP address on the IP_Repeat blacklist?
   - Yes:
     - Flag the message with IP_REPEAT and also add a header to the message containing debug information
     - Increment flagged counter in IP_Repeat blacklist
   - No:
     - If the Spam Assassin score is above the threshold (in our case 5) then add the IP address on the IP_Repeat blacklist (id of the message, timestamp and counter)</code>
  - **Aggregate Score (IP Repeat)**
    * Since the IP Repeat heuristic may generate false positives, it would be better to use it in combination with other tests.  Thus the Aggregate Score (IP Repeat) heuristic flags the message if it is satisfies the conditions of IP Repeat as described above and it has a user-based Spam Assassin score for the message is between 3 and 5.  It was seen that the bulk of unmarked spam messages occured in this range, as [[snap9_images-spam_assassin_dist.png|can be seen in this photo]].  The following steps are performed:<code>
- Is marked with IP Repeat?
   - Yes:
     - Is Spam Assassin score between 3 and 5?
       - Yes:
          - Flag with AGG_SCORE
  </code>
  - **DNS Blacklist**
    * All the servers are checked against a set of known [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL|DNS blacklists]] (in our case //sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org// and //bl.spamcop.net//).  Note that SpamAssassin score is based on its own checks against DNSBLs.  A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists|brief comparison]] of several DNSBLs shows how are the IP addresses added and removed on these lists and by whom. As in IP_Repeat, we are using the first IP outside Hopkins, because we know they are legitimate servers. Ideally, we can check here the entire SMTP path.<code>
- Identify the closest IP address outside of Hopkins address space using SMTP path included in the message header.
- If the IP address is on any of the blacklists:
  - Flag the message with DNSBL_FOUND</code>
  - **Dynamic Blacklist**
    * All the connecting servers are checked against a set of dynamic IP blacklists (specifically, //pbl.spamhaus.org// and //dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net//).  The idea is to flag all the messages coming from dialup and DHCP IP address space that is not meant to be initiating SMTP connections (they should use the ISP mail server instead).<code>
- If the connecting IP address is on any of the dynamic IP blacklists:
  - Flag the message with DYNAMIC_FOUND</code>
  - **IP Reject Log**
    * Any server whose connection has been rejected is placed on a local blacklist.  A message can be rejected for many reasons, such as an invalid recipient or sender address.  The blacklist is then utilized to mark all the proceeding messages coming from that server as spam.  As IP_Repeat, this rule can potentially generate easily false positives as servers can send both spam and non-spam messages. 
    * A daemon is running in background parsing the Exim reject log. Any IP address found here is added to the IP_Reject blacklist.  This daemon accepts TCP connections from the clients asking for an IP address. <code>
- If the IP address belongs to a legitimate server which frequently connects (we listed here ''blaze.cs.jhu.edu''):
  - return
- If the IP address is on the IP_Reject blacklist:
  - Flag the message with IP_REJECT and also add a header to the message containing debug information</code>

** IP Address Replacement: ** The DNS Blacklist and the IP Repeat heuristics both utilize the closest IP address outside of Hokpins.  This decision was made because there are many legitimate messages which come to Commedia from another Hopkins SMTP server.  The presence of a single spam from any one of these would trigger many false positives, thus the next IP in the path is utilized.  For instance, some accounts of the format, address@jhu.edu are forwarded to a Commedia account.  When a spam message is sent to such an address, it comes through the Hopkins SMTP Server for jhu.edu.  

[[ip_address_replace_msg_a|Look at a message in which this occured]].

=== Results ===

In this section we discuss the results given a snapshot taken from April 18 to April 23 with the following properties:

<code>
Total Spam Messages:  2062
Total Marked Spam Messages:  1916
Total Unmarked Spam Messages:  146
Total Nonspam Messages:  100
</code>

Given the sample of 2162 messages, we were able to flag 109 of the 146 unmarked messages by SpamAssassin.  That is equal to about 74% of the messages during this time.  The graph below shows the number of emails flagged with each heuristic and the spam assassin score assigned to each of these emails.

{{ snap9_images:spam_assassin_dist-unmarked_2.png }}

It is important to note that some messages are flagged by multiple heuristics.  Thus the sum of each point won't equal, but would exceed, the total number flagged since there is some overlap.  

<code>		Unmarked	Marked
IP Repeat: 	62		553
Host Name:	34		595
DNS BlackList:	4		1167
Agg Score: 	58		4
Reject:		27		89
Dynamic:	25		1049
</code>

The graph and data show that IP Repeat performs very well on our sample.  Host Name is also very good at predicting spam.  Since IP Repeat has a good chance of false positives, we added Agg Score, which catches most (58/62) of the same messages except those with low spam assassin scores.  The Reject and Dynamic do a fair job at detecting spam.  Finally, the DNS blacklist is of little value because Spam Assassin already uses DNS Blacklists in its evaluation of the message.

[[snap_snot_9a | In-Depth Analysis of this Snapshot]]\\

** Future Work **\\
  * Cross-User Analysis
    * It would be interesting to see how often messages with the same subject/content/sender-IP are sent across users.
  * [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting|Grey Listing]]
    * Though we wrote a script for this we did not have time to deploy it.  Doing so would also affect our results and be difficult to monitor, so we held off on this one.
  * Forgiveness
    *Statistics on the relative timing of messages blocked with IP Repeat have been gathered, with the possible focus of adding a concept of "forgiveness" to the blacklist to remove IPs after time.

===== Imposing Cost =====

Currently the cost of sending a spam message is equal to that of sending a legitimate message.  We wish to change this.  In order to do so we will cause the spammer to repeat the transmission of the network packets that combine to form the email.  We hope the increase in traffic will cause the spammer's network to become congested and prevent the transmission of as many messages over the same amount of time.

=== Verification of Technique ===

In order to verify the technique we wrote a small test program.  The program uses [[http://www.tcpdump.org/|libpcap]] and [[http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/|libnet]], offering the ability to sniff packets on the wire and inject packets respectively.  There are two modes of operation, normal and misbehaving mode.  Under normal operation the program acts as closely as possible to a legitimate TCP/IP connection.  Under misbehaving mode it only ACKs one packet per timeout interval.  The timeout interval is tuned to occur after the sender transmits its entire window but before those packets are retransmitted from a sender timeout.  Thus for each window transfer, the misbehaving mode acknolwedges only one packet.  That acknowedgment may be duplicated 3, 6, or 9 times to study the affect of fast-retransmission via ACK spoofing.

The results indicate that the number of packets for a payload similar to the average experienced spam, 10KB, the sender will transmit roughly four times that amount under misbehaving mode.  If progress is prevented, the size can be dramatically increased [stats coming].

For a 10KB file, we extend the ACK_NUM_1 test to repeat the same ack N times over N timeouts.  This is different from tests such as ACK_NUM_3 where we send 1 Ack and 2 Duplicates as fast as possible.  In this test, we want to slow progress so as to repeat a greater number of packets.

<code>

400	1733	1228681	447		24563		1286		1204118
</code>

Why does it take so many repeats?  This is because there is actually a small bug in the program.  Ideally it will repeat an ACK after it receives the window from the sender.  However, if it timesout 1 or more times b/w this point, it will use up some of its repeats.  So it is not operating under the most ideal conditions but still can be useful in showing potential for growth.

=== Implementation ===

In order to achieve this misbehaving ability in a production level environment we modify our design to be more robust.  Our previous solution was fairly hard coded.  We modify an implementation of the Light-Weight TCP/IP Stack [[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/|LWIP]] to perform this ack spoofing when configured to do so.  Packets destined for the mail server are forwarded by the Linux Firewall to a virtual network device (Tun/Tap) on which this 'user-level' stack operates.  Exim is modified to utilize the new stack.

This is still a work in progress.  The light-weight stack introduces complications in that it does not include DNS resolving code, a few IOCTL features, and quite a few structs native to the Linux TCP/IP implementation.  The code currently compiles with the lwip share library extension and header files but needs additional improvements to work fully.  We were also considering developing a linux module instead of this technique.
