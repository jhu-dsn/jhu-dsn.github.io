=== How many IPs send only spam, non-spam, aggregate? ===

The following was performed on snapshot 9, occuring from 4/18 to 4/23.  A set of Yair's email addresses was analyzed.
It contained 2062 spam messages, 1916 of which were marked by Spam Assassin, and 100 Nonspam messages.

For the most part, each IP sends a small number of messages.  There are some exceptions, such as with Omniti, which sends a total of 301 spam messages.

(Omniti)  66.225.209.50 Sent 301 Spam and 3 nonspam, thus it accounts for many of the aggregate scores.\\
(Omniti)   162.129.8.64 Sent 2   Spam and 13 Nonspam\\
(Commedia)128.220.221.1 Sent 3   Spam and 25 Nonspam\\

                        Total IPs:      Total Messages  Messages/IP
Spam:                   1265            1751            1.384
Nonspam:                30              46              1.533

=== How many messages are received per sender IP address (spam / non-spam)? ===
From this we see that most IP's sending spam send only 1 message.  This is only looking at Yair's spam and not the entire Commedia network however.  It should be noted that the IP Repeat blacklist is a product of spam assassin scores across more than just Yair's boxes.  Thus it can acheive better blocking than would be thought from the chart below.

<code>
spam  
 # messages # servers
         1:       940
         2:       184
         3:       138
         4:         6
         5:         1

=== How many spam messages not flagged as spam are sent by IPs that sent spam earlier? ===

This is the same as the IP_REPEAT heuristic, and can be seen by looking at the IP_REPEAT data on our results page.

=== For each spam, list the number of marked/unmarked spam sent previous to this point? ===

Data too large to place here, but again similar to IP_REPEAT heuristic

=== How many unflagged spam is sent by IPs that appeared in the reject log previous to the undetected spam? ===

Covered by the IP REJECT heuristic

=== With what frequency does the IP address appear in a blacklist? ===

Covered by the DNSBL heurstic

=== Distribution of Spam Assassin score for spam / non-spam messages? ===

Can be seen in graphs on results page

=== What is the average size of header / body for spam / non-spam messages? ====

=== What is the average length of the SMTP path for spam / non-spam messages? ===
Add this.

=== What is the average number of recipients for spam and non-spam messages? ===
Add this.

=== What is the amount of non-spam messages that come from blaze.cs.jhu.edu vs commedia? ===
Number is large, removed blaze from consideration.

=== What is the duration (1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, etc.) with which an IP address may be found in the log for spam / non-spam / aggregate email? ===

[[snap_shot_9#duration_and_frequency_analysis|Shown here]]

=== What is the frequency with which emails are sent per IP address (ie. 10 / minute, 10 / hour, 10 / day, etc.) for spam / non-spam? ===

[[snap_shot_9#duration_and_frequency_analysis|Shown here]]

=== How many times do spammers send n messages within x minutes? ===

[[snap_shot_9#duration_and_frequency_analysis|Shown here]]

=== How many times do legitimate servers send n messages within x minutes? ===

Performed, but needs to be uploaded.

=== What impact does the presence of the hostname (HN) have on the likelihood of a message to be spam? ===
This is a fairly good technique for this sample occuring from April 04 to April 09.

**HostName Statistics**
<code>
Total Marked Spam with HNAME:  1321     0.689
Total Unmarked Spam with HNAME:  112    0.767
Total Nonspam with HNAME:  100  1.000
</code>

=== At what frequency and time of day do the spam / non-spam messages usually arrive? ===
Will not help indicate spam from nonspam.

=== Perform the same questions as above with sender domains instead of sender IPs? ===
Not performed.

=== Do the spam / non-spam messages come from an ISP mail server or are they sent directly? ===
Not performed.

=== What is the frequency with which the same messages are sent to different users? ===
Not performed.

=== Does the same message get sent to multiple users? ===
Not performed.

=== How many users receive only spam, non-spam, aggregate? ===
We did not find this question important enough to investigate.
