Here we investigate manipulating the TCP/IP transfer in order to increment the cost to the sender.

The application makes use of packet sniffing and packet injection to do whatever it wants.  To initiate the transfer, the application makes a request for an html page from an Apache web server I have running in Windows XP.

When set to NORMAL_MODE the app tries to act as closely as possible to a normal TCP/IP connection.   Therefore this test can be used to compare the sniffing/injection quality against the real thing.  Obviously we didn't implement the whole stack, so for instance the window size indicated in our packets remains constant while the real stack would change this based on previous events.  We make a request from Firefox utilizing the Linux TCP/IP stack to provide a trace for comparison.

When set to MISBEHAVING_MODE, the sender sends its window of packets but is only sent one ACK for the very first packet.  Meaning it will have to retransmit all the other packets.  The app waits until a timeout (about .02 seconds) of the packet sniffer or until the earliest non-ACKed TCP packet is received for the second time, to send an ACK for that packet. 

Ex to illustrate model behavior:

(acknowledgment number is for next expected packet)
SENDER: SEQ_NUMS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
RECEIVER: ACK_NUMS: 2
SENDER: SEQ_NUMS: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
RECEIVER: ACK_NUMS: 3
SENDER: SEQ_NUMS: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
...

The number of duplicate ACKS sent by the receiver varies with the different tests to see what benefit this technique has.  Ideally three duplicate ACKs should mean fast retransmission, and thus, quicker recovery of the transmission window.  More than three should inflate the sender's window allowing more packets to be sent despite the previous loss.

Results:
The results seem to indicate that sending duplicate ACKs doesn't impact the number of retransmissions that much.  There is a small increase in the total bytes sent by the sender which is the result of it ACKing each duplicate ACK.  It's good enough for the receiver just to send the one ACK.  For the typical size of our spam, 10KB, when the receiver operates under MISBEHAVING_MODE the sender sends a total of 40KB.  So it's pretty much exactly as we calculated in class, a 1:4 ratio.

As seen can be seen in the tests, the amplification is larger with bigger pages, but this would flatten eventually and is irrelevant since spam isn't that big to begin with!
