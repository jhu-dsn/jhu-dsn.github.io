DNSBL adds little extra value to the prediction of unmarked, but performs well with marked, likely because it is already a significant component of Spam Assassin.

IP_REPEAT performs quite well, detecting 78/191 unmarked spam messages.  It also identifies quite a large number of marked messages, perhaps b/c IP_REPEAT is a blacklist and may find addresses in common with the DNSBL.

HOSTNAME finds a smaller, but still reasonable number of unmarked messages: 33/191.  Of the three tests it identifies the smallest number of marked messages: 435.  This is probably b/c this test is not employed by spam assassin.
