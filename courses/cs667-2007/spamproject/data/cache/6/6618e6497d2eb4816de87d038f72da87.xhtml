 This paper takes the approach of preventing outgoing spam in an enterprise network.  The idea is that only mail servers should be conducting <acronym title="Domain Name Server">DNS</acronym> MX record requests.  A client who wishes to send a legitimate email will connect to such a mail server, which will then perform a <acronym title="Domain Name Server">DNS</acronym> MX record request to locate the destination mail server corresponding to the recipient address.  A client that is a zombie will act as its own mail server, conducting the DSN MX request itself and directly connecting to the destination mail server.  It is shown that in a network of approximately 300 clients there is no legitimate reason for clients to perform their own <acronym title="Domain Name Server">DNS</acronym> MX lookups.  Thus the administrators of the enterprise network should scan for such behavior and disable port 25 connections of such offending clients.
