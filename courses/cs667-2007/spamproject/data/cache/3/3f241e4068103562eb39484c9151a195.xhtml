 The following was performed on snapshot 9, occuring from 4/18 to 4/23.  A set of Yair&rsquo;s email addresses was analyzed. It contained 2062 spam messages, 1916 of which were marked by Spam Assassin, and 100 Nonspam messages.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, each IP sends a small number of messages.  There are some exceptions, such as with Omniti, which sends a total of 301 spam messages.
</p>

<p>
(Omniti)  66.225.209.50 Sent 301 Spam and 3 nonspam, thus it accounts for many of the aggregate scores.<br/>
 (Omniti)   162.129.8.64 Sent 2   Spam and 13 Nonspam<br/>
 (Commedia)128.220.221.1 Sent 3   Spam and 25 Nonspam<br/>

<p>
From this we see that most IP&rsquo;s sending spam send only 1 message.  This is only looking at Yair&rsquo;s spam and not the entire Commedia network however.  It should be noted that the IP Repeat blacklist is a product of spam assassin scores across more than just Yair&rsquo;s boxes.  Thus it can acheive better blocking than would be thought from the chart below.
