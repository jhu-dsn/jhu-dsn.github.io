<p>
[April 16, 2007] Added new heuristic DYNAMIC_FOUND that checks a blacklist that lists dynamic IPs that should not be connecting directly.

</p>

<p>
[April 15, 2007] Because we plan to play with greylisting, I removed <em>blaze.cs.jhu.edu</em> as our backup MX server. 
</p>

<p>
[April 11, 2007] Small change in <em>exim_local_scan.py</em> to not scan messages (i.e, run our plugins) coming from authenticated <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> clients (on <code>commedia</code>). Need to check if this actually works <img src="/courses/cs667-2007/spamproject/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="middle" alt=":-)" />.
</p>

<p>
[April 10, 2007] IP_REPEAT plugin modified to save the original timestamp and message id, and the number of flagged emails. If a message is flagged, a message header is added with those 3 data.
</p>

<p>

[April 09, 2007] <a href="/courses/cs667-2007/spamproject/doku.php?id=ack_spoofing" class="wikilink1" title="ack_spoofing">ack_spoofing</a> added.

<p>
[April 03, 2007] Snapshot 5 created in <code>/storage/projects/spamproject/snapshot.5</code>
</p>

<p>
[April 03, 2007] <em>pathlen_plugin</em> disabled. Not clear when to suspect a message is a spam.
</p>

<p>
[April 03, 2007] Added a function to use the first IP outside Hopkins (<code>128.220.0.0, 162.129.0.0, 10.0.0.0, 192.168.0.0</code>). Currently used by <em>ip_heuristic</em> and <em>dnsbl_plugin</em>.
</p>

<p>
[April 03, 2007] Moved code to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; blaze ip from <em>exim_local_scan</em> to <em>ip_search</em> and upgraded to skip all local ips.  <em>exim_local_scan</em> no longer does this automatically, each interested plugin must do so. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
[April 03, 2007] Fixed a bug in <em>exim_local_scan.py</em>. When the connecting server was blaze, we considered the initiator instead of the second IP from the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> path. 
</p>

<p>
[April 03, 2007] Fixed a bug in <em>dnsbl_plugin</em>. All the previously marked messages were wrong :).
</p>

<p>
[April 02, 2007] Added the ability to mark messages only for specific users.
</p>

<p>
