 With the advent of social networking sites such as <a href="http://digg.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://digg.com/"  rel="nofollow">digg</a>, small websites accustomed to very little traffic can experience sudden booms in traffic, often crippling the server hosting the site.  This project aims to solve this problem, which is not restrained to the likes of digg, from the standpoint of a web hosting service provider by creating a means to actively and dynamically distribute the resources of a server cluster to the sites that need it most.  The techniques used to achieve this goal also allow for optimal distribution of sites across the servers in the cluster, thus allowing the hosting service to get the most out of the hardware resources available to them.  In addition, this project addresses the need for a load balancer module for Apache 2 which distributes requests using a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; algorithm based off of server load, not the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; round-robin style algorithms currently available.
