		Our aim is enable secure communication between two hosts, seamlessly using a pair of NEXX routers. 
		We use two NEXX routers with OpenWRT an open source linux operating system for embedded devices. Two NEXX routers
		are connected over a WAN. They both act as access points to their respective internal LAN networks. When a machine in an internal network 
		wants to communicate with another machine in another internal network, the data packets that are sent, are first intercepted 
		by the access point and then encrypted before being sent out on the WAN. The other router, on receiving packets from the WAN,
		destined for the internal network, decrypts them. This process is entirely transparent to the hosts at both ends.</div>
