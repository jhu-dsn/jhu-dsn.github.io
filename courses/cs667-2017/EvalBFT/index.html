						<h2>Evaluating BFT Protocols for Spire</h2>

					</header>
					<p>
						Our goal is to survey Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol implementations, and identify the best option that meets the performance and scalability requirements of the <a href="http://dsn.jhu.edu/spire">Spire</a> system. Benchmarking results, conclusions, and a discussion of next steps are available in the presentation slides. This project is for <a href="http://dsn.jhu.edu/courses/cs667/">Advanced Distributed Systems and Networks</a> (Spring 2017).

								<h3>Overview</h3>
							</header>
							<div class="content">

								<p>SCADA (<em>Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition</em>) systems run the world's infrastructure, controlling everything from regional power stations to nuclear aircraft carriers. In the past these systems communicated using proprietary protocols. As a result, there was little thought given to security, and very few cyber-threats to these systems, Stuxnet being the notable exception. Now, however, many of these systems are being plugged into the internet as a means of saving money and can no longer rely on an air gap to protect them. The DSN lab has developed a system, Spire, to provide SCADA systems with intrusion tolerance and other security features.</p>
								<p>The core of Spire is Prime, an intrusion-tolerant consensus algorithm. While Prime guarantees bounded performance under attack - a must for SCADA systems that need to respond to events in 100s of milliseconds - it brings with it complexity that does not scale well, putting a limit on the number of Prime replicas there can be in the Spire system and ultimately limiting the number of intrusions the system can tolerate.</p>
								<p>Our work has been looking into alternatives to the current Prime implemetation to provide better performance and scalability. We first considered using trusted hardware to reduce the number of replicas needed to tolerate a fault, though ultimately this proved unfeasible as the hardware was too slow. We then began a survey of other intrusion tolerant protocols, and ultimately selected BFT-SMART as a viable candidate to achieve high performance in Spire. Our results and discussion are available in the presentation slides.</p>
