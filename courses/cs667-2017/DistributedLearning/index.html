                <p>Reinforcement learning in Virtual Realistic Environment can be rather slow restricted by 
                the computation capability of the machine if we run the learning algorithm and interactions with 
                environment all on a single one. This project develops a distributed system to speed up 
                the learning process by dividing the learning task and parallelizing onto multiple machines.</p>

                <p>Our system has a two-stage speed-up architecture. First we separate out the part of the 
                interactions with environment, run multiple interactions on different machines at the same time 
                instead of originally only one on the same machine where the learning algorithm is running. 
                Since in virtual realistic environment the interactions are a lot slower than the speed of 
                learning algorithm, this way we are able to make the interactions keep up with the speed of learning. 
                Second we parallelize the learning process, run the learning algorithm on multiple machines at the 
                same time. This way we are able to let each machine do a part of job and get overall speed-up. 
                We basically have two versions for this stage, one is centralized with a parameter server collecting 
                data from all the learning processes (according to Tensorflow Distributed System), and the other one 
                is a P2P version where multiple learning processes directly communicate with each other through 
                multicasting.</p>

                <p>Then we investigate the problem of applying our system to physical environments with an easy-to-get 
                robotic arm. The real arm can be virtualized into an arm model, and we are able to gather data from 
                the physical environments through the virtual model after analyzing the model with computer vision 
                techniques, then our system can be applied to process these data and perform learning tasks. 
                Hence we proved that our system has the potential capability to be applied to real environments. 
                Some future work may focus on actually achieving this goal.</p>
