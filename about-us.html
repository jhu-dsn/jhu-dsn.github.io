            <p>The Distributed Systems and Networks (DSN) Lab is a research lab
            in the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Computer Science Department.
            We strive to invent and develop technologies with both academic and
            real-world impacts. We create practical, provably correct
            technological solutions to real problems and implement those
            solutions in publicly available software.</p>

            <p>Our research focuses on dependable infrastructure: making the
            computerized networked infrastructure our society relies upon
            resilient, performant, and secure. Our current work includes:</p>

            <ul>
            
            <li><b>Real-Time Byzantine Resilient Systems:</b> Critical applications 
            are migrating to IP networks for cost-effectiveness and scalability, but 
            this transition exposes our society's infrastructure to malicious cyber attacks.
            The rising number of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure reinforces 
            the need to build Byzantine resilient systems that function correctly 
            even while parts of them are compromised. While Byzantine resilient techniques 
            have been developed in the context of IT applications, applying them in the 
            critical infrastruture domain brings the need to consider strict requirements including
            real-time responsiveness, continuous availability, correctness and guranteed 
            performance even under attack. While our earlier work focused on power grid control centers, 
            we currently explore one of the the most important and 
            challenging use case and develop the first real-time Byzantine Resilient 
            architecture and protocols for the power grid substations. 
            
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Severe Impact Resilient Systems:</b> The joint threats of increasingly frequent severe natural disasters 
            and follow-on sophisticated malicious cyberattacks are becoming increasingly realistic and 
            seriously threaten critical infrastructure systems. This novel threat model and the impact of such threats 
            on critical infrastructure are not well understood. The research defines the threat model and develops a 
            framework to assess the impact of novel compound threats on critical infrastructure 
            with the aim to develop severe impact resilient systems for critical infrastruture. The work aims to design, develop and deploy 
            systems with novel architectures to address the compound threat using a combination of intrusion-tolerant techniques, mobile solutions and 
            flexibity.
            </li><br>
            
            
            <li><b>Real-Time Reliable Internet Services:</b> New applications
            with low latency and high reliability requirements, such as live TV
            transport and remote robotic surgery, are challenging to support on
            the native Internet. We create overlay networks that push
            intelligence to the middle of the network to enable these demanding
            applications to run effectively over the Internet at a global
            scale.</li><br>
            
            <li><b>Communication and Coordination for Modern Data Centers:</b>
            Today's cloud applications have a variety of communication and
            coordination needs, both within a single data center and among
            geographically dispersed data centers. We create messaging and
            coordination systems that guarantee the strong semantics and high
            performance required by today's cloud applications.</li>

            <p>Our research has resulted in practical open-source software
            systems available <a href="./softwares.html">here</a>. The primary
            systems involved in our current research are:</p>

            <ul>

            <li><b><a href="https://jhu-dsn.github.io/spire">Spire</a>:</b> Spire is an open-source intrusion-tolerant SCADA system for the power grid. Spire is designed to        withstand attacks and compromises at both the system level and the network level, while meeting the timeliness requirements of power grid monitoring and control systems (on the  order of 100-200ms update latency).</li><br>

            <li><b><a href="https://spines-org.github.io">Spines</a>:</b> Spines is a
            framework for deploying software overlay routers. Our current
            research includes implementing intrusion-tolerant messaging
            protocols in Spines and investigating techniques to support
            applications with extremely low latency and high reliability
            requirements on a continent or even global scale.</li><br>

            <li><b><a
            href="https://jhu-dsn.github.io/prime">Prime</a>:</b>
            Prime is a replication engine that provides performance guarantees
            under attack. Our current research integrates proactive recovery
            and dynamic diversity into Prime to create a highly-resilient
            system that can survive an unbounded number of compromises over the
            lifetime of the system (as long as the number of simultaneous
            compromises does not exceed a certain threshold, an assumption
            which is supported by the use of dynamic diversity).</li><br>

            <li><b><a href="http://www.spread.org">Spread</a>:</b> Spread is a
            widely-used group communication toolkit that provides reliable
            messaging as well as total ordering and delivery guarantees, with
            strong well-defined semantics in the presence of process failures
            and network partitions. Our recent research includes developing a
            new total ordering protocol that improves both the throughput and
            latency of Spread's message-delivery services.</li><br>
