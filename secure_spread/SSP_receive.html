<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>SSP_receive</B>

is the general purpose receive function for the
toolkit.  This receives not only data messages but also membership
messages for the connection.  Messages for all groups joined on
this connection will arrive to the same mailbox so a call to 
<B>SSP_receive</B>

will get a single 'message' from any one of the 
groups. After the receive completes a number of fields are set to 
values indicating meta information about the message (such as groups,
mess_type, endianness, type, etc).
<P>
This function is the most complex used in Spread because it is the 
only way for the system to return information to the application. The
meaning of many of the fields changes depending on whether the message
is a data message or a membership message.
<P>
The 
<B>SSP_receive </B>

function will block if no messages are available. If the function
is called with the 
<I>service</I>

set to DONT_BLOCK, then the call does not block if no message is
available.
<P>
The
<I>mbox</I>

gives which connection to receive a message on.
<I>Service_type</I>

is a pointer to a variable of type 'service' which will be set 
to the message type of the message just received.  This
will be either a REG_MESSAGE or MEMBERSHIP_MESS, and the specific type.
<P>
<P>
The rest of the parameters differ in meaning depending on the 
<I>service_type. </I>

If the
<I>service_type</I>

is a REG_MESSAGE (i.e. data message) then:
<P>
The
<I>sender</I>

is a pointer to an array of characters of at least MAX_GROUP_NAME size.  
This will be set to the name of the sending connection(its private group name).
<P>
The 
<I>max_groups</I>

is the maximum number of groups you have allocated space for in 
the 'groups' array passed to the receive function.
<P>
<I>Num_groups</I>

is a pointer to an int which will be set to the number of groups 
set in the 'groups' array.
<P>
The 
<I>groups</I>

array holds upto
<I>max_groups</I>

group names, each of which is a string of at most MAX_GROUP_NAME characters. All
of the groups which are receiving this message will be listed here, unless the array
is too small and then as many as can fit will be listed and the 
<I>num_groups</I>

value will be set to be negative. For example, if your groups array could store 5 
group names, but a message for 7 groups arrived, the first five group names would
appear in the
<I>groups</I>

array and  
<I>num_groups</I>

would be set to -7.
<P>
The 
<I>mess_type</I>

field will be set to the message type field the application sent with the 
original message, this is only a short int (16bits). This value is already
endian corrected before the application receives it.
<P>
<I>Endian_mismatch</I>

will be set to true (1) if the endianness of the sending machine 
differs from that of this receiving machine.
<P>
The actual message body being received will be passed into the buffer given by
<I>mess</I>

which is at least 
<I>max_mess_len </I>

bytes in size. If the message being received is larger then this buffer the  extra
data will be discarded by the system and the return value of 
<B>SSP_receive</B>

will indicate an error.
The number of messages still waiting for you in the queue is given by 
<I>more_messes.</I>

If the
<B>SSP_scat_receive</B>

form is used then instead of the
<I>mess</I>

buffer and length fields, a single 
<I>scat_mess</I>

scatter structure should be passed to receive filled in with whatever buffers
you wish to receive into and their lengths. These buffers must be valid memory areas.
They will be filled in by the receive call in the order they are listed.
<P>
If this is a MEMB_MESSAGE (i.e. membership message) and it 
specifically is a TRANS_MESS, then:
<P>
The 
<I>sender</I>

char array will be set to the name of the group for which the membership change is occuring.
<P>
The 
<I>max_groups</I>

and 
<I>max_mess_len</I>

fields are not used and the
<I>num_groups</I>

is 0 and 
<I>groups</I>

since there are no normal groups for a transitional membership, the sender field is used instead. 
The 
<I>mess_type</I>

field is set to -1. The
<I>endian_mismatch</I>

field will be zero since the transitional does not have any endian issues. The
<I>mess</I>

field will be left empty.
So in essence the only information you get is the 
<I>sender</I>

field is 
set to the group name which received a transitional membership change. The importance
of the TRANS_MEMB_MESS is that it tells the application that all messages received
after it and before the REG_MEMB_MESS for the same group are 'clean up' messages to
put the messages in a consistant state before actually changing memberships.  For more
explanations of this please see other documentation and research papers.
<P>
If This is a MEMB_MESSAGE (i.e. membership message) and it 
specifically is a REG_MEMB_MESS, then:
<P>
The 
<I>sender</I>

char array will be set to the name of the group for which the membership change is occuring.
<P>
The 
<I>max_groups</I>

and
<I>max_mess_len</I>

fields have the same meaning as before, and the 
<I>mess_type</I>

field will be set to the index of this process in the array of group members. The
<I>endian_mismatch</I>

field will again be set to 0 since there are no endian issues with regular memberships.
<P>
The
<I>groups</I>

array and
<I>mess</I>

body are used to provide two kinds of membership information about the change that just
occured in this group.  The 
<I>num_groups</I>

field will be set to the number of members in the group in the 
<B>new</B>

membership (i.e. after the change occured). Correspondingly the 
<I>groups</I>

array will be set to the private group names of all members of this group
in the 
<B>new</B>

membership.  This list of names is always in the same order at all receipients
and thus can be used to deterministically pick a group representative if
one is needed by the application.
<P>
The second set of information is stored in the message body and provides a list
of all the private group names of those processes which came with your process
from the old group membership into this new membership. The data buffer will include
the following fixed length fields:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>group_id;</B>

<DD>
<BR>

<DT><B>int num_members;</B>

<DD>
<BR>

<DT><B>char groups[][MAX_GROUP_NAME];</B>

<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The groups array will have num_members group names, each of which is
a fixed length string.  The content of the groups array is dependent 
upon the type of the membership change:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>CAUSED_BY_JOIN:</B>

<DD>
Groups contains the private group of the joining process.
<DT><B>CAUSED_BY_LEAVE:</B>

<DD>
Groups contains the private group of the leaving process.
<DT><B>CAUSED_BY_DISCONNECT:</B>

<DD>
Groups contains the private group of the disconnecting process.
<DT><B>CAUSED_BY_NETWORK:</B>

<DD>
Groups contains the group names of the members of the new membership who came 
with 
<B>me</B>

(the current process) to the new membership. Of course, all 
<B>new </B>

members can be determined by comparing it with the groups parameter of
the SSP_receive call.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
If this is a MEMB_MESSAGE (i.e. membership message) and it is
<B>neither</B>

a REG_MEMB_MESS or a TRANS_MEMB_MESS, then it represents exactly the 
situtation where the member receiving this message has left a group and
this is notification that the leave has occured, thus it is sometimes called 
a 
<B>self-leave</B>

message.  The simplest test for this is if a message is CAUSED_BY_LEAVE and 
REG_MEMB_MESS is FALSE then it is a 
<B>self-leave</B>

message.  TRANS_MEMB_MESS never have a CAUSED_BY_ type because they only serve
to signal upto where SAVE delivery and AGREED delivery (with no holes) is guaranteed
in the complete 
<B>old</B>

group membership.
<P>
The other members of the group this member just left will receive a normal TRANS_MEMB_MESS, 
REG_MEMB_MESS pair as described above showing the membership change.
<P>
The fields of SSP_receive in this case will be as follows:
<P>
The 
<I>sender</I>

char array will be set to the name of the group for which the membership change is occuring.
<P>
The 
<I>max_groups</I>

and
<I>max_mess_len</I>

fields have the same meaning as before, and the 
<I>mess_type</I>

and 
<I>endian_mismatch</I>

fields will again be set to 0.
<P>
The
<I>groups</I>

array and
<I>mess</I>

body are used to provide two kinds of membership information about the change that just
occured in this group.  The 
<I>num_groups</I>

field will be set to 0 and the 
<I>groups</I>

array will be empty, since this member is no longer part of the group and thus has
no knowledge of it.
<P>
The second set of information is stored in the message body and provides a the
private group name of the member who just left, which should always be the
private group name of the connection which received this message.
The data buffer will include the following fixed length fields:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>group_id;</B>

<DD>
<BR>

<DT><B>int num_members;</B>

<DD>
<BR>

<DT><B>char groups[][MAX_GROUP_NAME];</B>

<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The groups array will have num_members group names, each of which is
a fixed length string.  The content of the groups array will be the 
private group of the leaving process, since this case only occurs with
a CAUSED_BY_LEAVE membership change.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

Returns the size of the message received 
on success or one of the following errors ( &lt; 0 ):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_SESSION</B>

<DD>
The 
<I>mbox</I>

given to receive on was illegal.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_MESSAGE</B>

<DD>
The message had an illegal structure, like a scatter not filled out correctly.
<DT><B>CONNECTION_CLOSED</B>

<DD>
During communication to receive the message communication errors occured
and the receive could not be completed.
<DT><B>BUFFER_TOO_SHORT</B>

<DD>
If the message body buffer
<I>mess</I>

is too short to hold the message being received, this is returned.
<DT><B>WOULD_BLOCK</B>

<DD>
A receive call with DONT_BLOCK set would have blocked.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_PARAM</B>

<DD>
A call was made with an illegal size (negative).
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_MESSAGE</B>

<DD>
The message had an illegal structure, like a scatter not filled out correctly,
plus a receive call with an illegal scatter (num_elements was illegal 
(size &lt; 0 || size &gt; FL_MAX_SCATTER_ELEMENTS) or a scatter buffer 
size was negative.
