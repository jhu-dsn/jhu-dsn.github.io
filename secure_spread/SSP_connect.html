<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>SSP_connect</B>

is the initial call an application must make to establish a
connection with a Spread daemon.  All other spread calls must
refer to a valid 
<I>mbox </I>

returned by this function.
<P>
The 
<I>spread_name</I>

is the name of the Spread daemon to connect to.  It should be a
string in one of the following forms:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>4803 </B>

<DD>
This will connect to the Spread daemon on the local 
machine running on port 4803.  This form cannot be
used to connect to a Windows95/NT machine.
<DT><B>4803@localhost </B>

<DD>
This will also connect to the Spread daemon 
on the local machine running on port 4803.
This form can be used on Windows95/NT machines.
<DT><B>4803@host.domain.edu</B>or<B>4803@128.220.221.99</B>

<DD>
This will connect to the machine identified by either 
domain name or IP address at the specified port. 
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The
<I>private_name </I>

is the name this connection would like to be known as.  It
must be unique on the machine running the spread daemon.  The 
name can be of at most MAX_PRIVATE_NAME characters, with the same character
restrictions as a group name (mainly it cannot contain the '#'
character).
<P>
The
<I>priority</I>

is a 0/1 flag for whether this connection will be a &quot;Priority&quot; 
connection or not. Currently this has no effect.
<P>
The 
<I>group_membership</I>

is a boolean integer.  If 1 then the application will 
receive group membership messages for this connection, 
if 0 then the application will 
<B>not</B>

receive 
<B>any</B>

membership change messages. For Secure Spread is not used,
the application must and will receive membership notifications.
It is used just for compatibility with SP_connect.
<P>
The
<I>mbox</I>

should be a pointer to a mailbox variable.  After the 
<B>SSP_connect</B>

call returns this variable will hold the mbox for
the connection.
<P>
The
<I>private_group</I>

should be a pointer to a string big 
enough to hold at least MAX_GROUP_NAME characters.  
After the Connect call returns it will contain the private 
group name of this connection.  This group name can be used to
send unicast messages to this connection and no one can join 
this special group.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

Returns 
<B>ACCEPT_SESSION </B>

on success or one of the following errors ( &lt; 0 ):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_SPREAD</B>

<DD>
The 
<I>spread_name</I>

given to connect to was illegal for some reason. Usually because
it was a unix socket on Windows95/NT, an improper format for a host
or an illegal port number
<DT><B>COULD_NOT_CONNECT</B>

<DD>
Lower level socket calls failed to allow a connection to the 
specified spread daemon right now.
<DT><B>CONNECTION_CLOSED</B>

<DD>
During communication to establish the connection errors occured
and the setup could not be completed.
<DT><B>REJECT_VERSION</B>

<DD>
The daemon or library has a version mismatch.
<DT><B>REJECT_NO_NAME</B>

<DD>
No user private name was provided.
<DT><B>REJECT_ILLEGAL_NAME</B>

<DD>
Name provided violated some requirement (length or used an illegal character)
<DT><B>REJECT_NOT_UNIQUE</B>

<DD>
Name provided is not unique on this daemon. Recommended response is to try
again with a different name.
