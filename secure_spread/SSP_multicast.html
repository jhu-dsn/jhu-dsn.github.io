<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>SSP_multicast</B>

and its variants all can multicast a message to a group.  The 
message is sent on a particular connection and is marked as having come from the
connection who sent it.
The
<I>service_type</I>

is a type field that should be set to the service this message
requires. The valid flags for messages are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<B>UNRELIABLE_MESS</B>

<BR>


<B>RELIABLE_MESS </B>

<BR>


<B>FIFO_MESS</B>

<BR>


<B>CAUSAL_MESS</B>

<BR>


<B>AGREED_MESS</B>

<BR>


<B>SAFE_MESS</B>

</DL>

<P>
This type 
can be bit ORed with other flags like SELF_DISCARD or ENCRYPT_MESS 
if desired. SELF_DISCARD specifies that the message is sent to all the members of the
group, but the sender and ENCRYPT_MESS specifies that the message will be encrypted.
<P>
The
<I>group</I>

string should include the name of the group to send to. 
The group has a string name of no
more then MAX_GROUP_NAME chars. 
<P>
The
<I>mess_type</I>

is a SHORT int (16 bits) which can be used by the 
application arbitrarily.  The intent is that it could be used 
to NAME different kinds of data messages so they can be
differentiated without looking into the body of the message.
This value 
<B>will </B>

be endian corrected before receiving. 
<P>
If the non-scatter varients are being used then a single buffer is
passed to the multicast call specifying the full message to be sent.
The 
<I>mess_len</I>

field gives the length in bytes of the message. While the
<I>mess</I>

field is a pointer to the buffer containing the message.
For a scatter call both of these are replaced with one pointer,
<I>scat_mess,</I>

to a scatter structure, which is just like an iovec.  This allows 
messages made up of several parts to be sent without an extra copy
on systems which support scatter-gather.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

Returns the number of bytes sent
on success or one of the following errors ( &lt; 0 ):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_SESSION</B>

<DD>
The 
<I>mbox</I>

given to multicast on was illegal.
<DT><B>CONNECTION_CLOSED</B>

<DD>
During communication to send the message errors occured
and the send could not be completed.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_PARAM   </B>

<DD>
A call was made with an illegal size (negative)
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_STATE        </B>

<DD>
A send call was made in a prohibited state: such as sending
messages to a group after sending a flush to the group and before
receiving a membership in that group, or sending a flush before receiving
a flush request or after having already sent a flush.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_RECEIVERS   </B>

<DD>
A send call to a group with SUBGROUP_CAST set specified
receivers that weren't legal for that group.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_MESSAGE</B>

<DD>
The message had an illegal structure, like a scatter not filled out correctly,
or a send with an illegal scatter (num_elements was illegal (size &lt; 0 || size &gt;
FL_MAX_SCATTER_ELEMENTS) or a scatter buffer size was negative.
<DT><B>ILLEGAL_MESSAGE_TYPE</B>

<DD>
A send call used reserved a message type (see MIN_LEGAL_MESS_TYPE in fl.h)
<DT><B>GROUP_NOT_SECURE</B>

<DD>
The group that you sent to have not finish yet the key agreement algorithm and
there is no group key to be used for encryting data.
